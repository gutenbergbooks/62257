<p class="ph2">PREFACE.</p></div>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little work is undertaken because it is believed
that no treatise on the construction of organs, at
once short, practical, and accessible by all classes
of readers, is extant.</p>

<p>The bulky volume of Hopkins and Rimbault,
worthy as it is of all commendation, and abounding
with matter interesting to the musician, does not
profess to enter into details essential to the workman.
The same remark may be applied to sundry
treatises in the form of articles contributed to
Encyclop√¶dias, or to periodicals of a popular kind.
The writers of these articles, probably fully masters
of the subject, cannot, from the very nature of the
case, command the time, space, and amplitude of
illustration absolutely necessary for the full elucidation
of the mechanical processes involved in the
construction of the most elaborate and ingenious
of all musical instruments.</p>

<p>Readers of the French language, indeed, may
find all that they require in a most admirable
and exhaustive work, the "Facteur d'Orgues," by
M. Hamel, forming one of the series of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
"Manuels-Roret," published in 1849 by Roret of
Paris, in three volumes, with an atlas of plates.
The author of this complete exposition of the
organ-builder's art has taken for the foundation of
his book the great work of Dom Bedos, a Benedictine
monk, who printed in 1766-78, at Paris, two
sumptuous folio volumes, with plates, which leave
unnoticed nothing which was known or practised
by the workmen of his period. The modern editor,
however, who displays a most intimate knowledge
of his subject, together with an enviable power of
explaining it in all its minutest details, aided, as
he is, by the most accurate of all European
languages, has produced in his third volume a
manual of the art of organ-building in recent
times, which covers the whole field of investigation,
and of which it is not too much to say that it
can never be surpassed.</p>

<p>A somewhat indifferent translation of a German
treatise on the "Organ and its Construction," by
Herr Seidel, of Breslau, appeared some years ago.
But this work, like the English publication first
noticed, is not for the dwellers in workshops, but
for organists, choir-masters, clergymen, and others
entrusted with the care of existing organs, or likely
to be concerned in the erection of new ones.</p>

<p>The writer has lately perused, with much pleasure
and advantage, a tract of about forty pages on
"Organ Voicing and Tuning," published for the
author (evidently a practical operator). He can
warmly recommend this unpretending introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
to the highest branch of the art, so seldom mastered
save by those who have had the advantage of early
and assiduous practice under skilled guidance.
But it deals, of course, with that highest branch
only, and assumes previous knowledge of mechanical
construction.</p>

<p>He himself, several years ago, contributed a
short series of articles on the construction of small
organs to a periodical publication now extinct.
The letters which he received from working men,
urging him to treat the subject in greater detail,
furnished a striking proof of the extent to which
the leisure hours of many artisans are devoted to
the production of an organ in some one of its
innumerable forms, from the toy with two or three
stops to the complete instrument with as many
rows of keys. Such inquirers will not be satisfied,
he fears, by the narratives of "How we made
our First Organ," and the like, in well-meant
and otherwise well-written books for boys. The
real difficulties of organ-building (and they are
numerous) are simply evaded in some recent
books of this kind, which convey the irresistible
impression that their authors are not themselves
handlers of the plane and chisel. The true workman
knows full well that the very simplest of
organs cannot be put together in a few weeks, out
of school-hours, and side by side with other undertakings.</p>

<p>If the present work, in which the writer describes
the results of his own experience, and lays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
down no rules which he has not reduced to practice
in his own workshop, should have the effect of
deterring ingenious boys from attempting their
"First Organ" until the possession of a large
stock of patience, as well as the command of
leisure, and of means moderately adequate for the
purchase of good materials, are abundantly and
unmistakably assured to them, the author, once a
plodding and untiring boy-workman himself, will
have reason to be satisfied that his efforts to explain
a complicated and intricate structure have
not been entirely fruitless.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the publication of this work, the author has
had reason to believe that some hints as to the
design and erection of small organs in country
churches may be acceptable to readers who occupy
the position, not of constructors, but of purchasers.
He trusts that the chapter now added, "On Village
Church Organs," will be found to contain the
desired information.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="c1">ORGAN-BUILDING.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="printers mark" />
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="c"><i>PLANT AND MATERIALS.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall assume at once, and at the very outset,
that our reader has the fixed purpose of producing
an organ which shall be creditable to its builder, a
source of pleasure to its players and their hearers,
and an ornament to the room or building in which
it is erected: in short, that he remembers the
excellent maxim, "whatever is worth doing at all,
is worth doing well," and will not be content with
rough workmanship, inferior materials, and inharmonious
results.</p>

<p>Assuming this as the basis and principle of all
our suggestions, we shall nevertheless bear in mind
the necessity of adapting our rules to the conditions
imposed by slender purses, and the imperfect appliances
of humble workshops. Without attempting
to quote the actual market prices of the wood,
leather, and metal required, or of those important
parts of the instrument which in most cases will be
purchased ready-made, we shall endeavour to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
how economy may be consulted by obtaining all
these gradually, as our work advances with that
inevitably slow progress which attends all proceedings
in which most haste is found to be worse
speed.</p>

<p>We shall buy nothing which we can make for
ourselves. The common sense of our readers may
be trusted not to press the application of this rule
to a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. As we shall certainly
buy, and not make, our screws and nails, so in the
course of the following pages we may possibly
recommend the buying of certain parts of the work,
in full remembrance of our rule. But even in these
occasional instances we shall probably point out
how expenditure may be saved by patient industry.
We need not anticipate. Our readers will see for
themselves what we mean as we go on.</p>

<p>Our task will be somewhat simplified if we suppose
that an organ is desired for a room of moderate
size. Such an instrument will commonly have one
manual, or row of keys, with four or five stops, or
sets of pipes. Pedals, with or without pipes of their
own of deep bass quality, must be considered
essential in every organ making any pretension to
completeness, or intended to afford useful practice
for learners. Taking this as a rough outline or
sketch of probable plans, it will be easy to see hereafter
how they may be indefinitely extended.</p>

<p>Our organ factory, then (with some such plan in
our head), must be a roomy, well-lighted, perfectly
dry workshop, furnished with a fire-place or stove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
for the glue-pot, with drawers or cupboards for
storing away skins of leather and other materials
not in constant requirement, and with shelves on
which pipes may be stowed without danger of
rolling off. It must not be a mere shed or hovel in
which we might mend the cart or the wheel-barrow,
and it should not be far from our dwelling-house,
if we are likely to work at our serious undertaking
in the winter evenings.</p>

<p>The shop must be fitted with a full-sized bench
in good condition, that is to say, with its top dressed
truly, and not hacked by rough usage; and good
workmanship will be much promoted if the usual
appliances of such a bench are of the best kind and
in complete order. True planing, so vitally essential
in organ-building, cannot be done upon a crazy
or worn-out bench. The bench should stand near
a window, and it should be so placed that boards
much longer than itself may be occasionally dressed
upon it by temporary arrangements.</p>

<p>The tools required are chiefly those which are
common to every joiner's shop; notably and of first
importance the three planes, the jack, the jointer or
trying plane, and the little smoothing plane. This
last may now be bought in a very handy form,
entirely of iron, and fitted with a clever adjustment
by which the cutter can be set to any degree of
fineness. This little plane (an American invention)
is invaluable for many purposes involving extreme
neatness and accuracy. The planes must at all
times be kept in first-rate order, and any defect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which makes its appearance must be instantly
rectified by a careful use of the oil stone. The
latter, let us mention by the way, as we may have
youthful and inexperienced readers, should be
levelled occasionally by being rubbed on a flat
slab with sand and water. The plane is emphatically
<i>the</i> tool of the organ-builder, and no pains
should be considered too great to be bestowed on
the care of these beautiful tools, or on the attainment
of dexterity in the use of them.</p>

<p>The usual saws, the ripping saw, the panel saw,
the dovetail, the key-hole or pad saw, will be
required; and we may take this opportunity of
remarking that as the organ-builder must have a
strong dash of the smith as well as of the joiner in
his composition, his shop must have a stout vice
fixed in a convenient part of it, and a few good
files always available for brass or for iron. (The
reader is doubtless aware that the same file must
not be used for both these metals.) Drills for
metal, some of them of small clockmaker's sizes
with a bow and breast-plate for working them,
will belong to this department, which will also
include a screw-plate for tapping wires of various
sizes from one-eighth of an inch downwards, and
cutting pliers or nippers for dividing the wire.</p>

<p>The tool-chest must contain a thoroughly good
brace and bits; and among the last should be
some one of the various forms of adjustable centre-bits
for cutting large circular holes of graduated
dimensions up to 3 inches diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with this it may here be mentioned
that most of the holes bored with the brace and
bits (though not the huge holes just referred to),
will be scorched or charred with a red-hot iron,
in order to clear them of splinters, and allow a
perfectly free passage for the air which will pass
through them. A few pieces of iron rod, of sizes
suitable for this purpose, will therefore be required.
Many of these holes will be also countersunk, that
is, rendered conical at their extremity, in order to
receive the conical feet of the pipes which receive
from these conduits their supply of wind. This
countersunk portion is also scorched or charred,
and two or three conical irons will be wanted for
this purpose. But we have not yet come to this.
When we are ready for these irons, we can have
them made by any blacksmith, or we may have
put aside some stout morsels of old iron from
which we ourselves may contrive to fashion
them.</p>

<p>An important question must next be asked.</p>

<p>Is a turning-lathe absolutely necessary as part
of the plant of our factory? We must answer this.
We should be sorry to deny that a small organ
certainly can be and may be built without the aid
of a lathe. We know that it has been done. But
it is equally undeniable that the absence of a lathe,
or of access to a lathe, will necessitate the purchase
of certain parts (wooden pipe-feet for
instance, and rack-pins), at an outlay which will
bear an appreciable proportion to the first cost of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a simple and inexpensive machine. Pressed, then,
to say if our workshop must include a lathe, we
are bound to reply in the affirmative, explaining,
in the same breath, that all the purposes of the
young organ-builder will be answered by a lathe
of humble character and trifling cost. We ourselves,
during several years of early beginnings,
used a small clockmaker's lathe by Fenn, of Newgate
Street, just capable of admitting between its
centres the little billet of wood ready for shaping
as a pipe-foot, that is to say, about 7 inches
in length, and from 2 inches down to half an
inch in diameter. We still possess this little lathe,
and still sometimes use it for small work. Some
such simple lathe, or some lathe still simpler,
being voted as necessary, the usual turning-chisels
and gouges will of course accompany it, and we
shall assume that our readers possess a sufficient
acquaintance with the wood-turner's art to require
no hints from us on the subject other than those
which we shall give in regular course as we
proceed. If they are fortunate enough to possess
a superior lathe, with slide-rest and slow motion
for turning iron and brass, they will find the
machine most conducive to good and durable
workmanship, and we shall not hesitate to point
out, as we go on, how materially it will assist us
in giving strength, firmness, and finish, to various
parts of our work.</p>

<p>We have furnished, then, our workshop, or
rather, let us say, we see it in our "mind's eye"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
furnished as we should wish it to be. And now we
may lay in our stock of wood.</p>

<p>Several boards of half-inch pine, perfectly dry
and sound, without knots; these are of first necessity.
Such boards are generally about 12 feet in
length and from 12 to 15 or even 20 or more inches
in breadth. If a little stock can be laid in of such
boards when an opportunity occurs of obtaining
exceptionally clean stuff, it will be well to have them
by us. A board or two of three-quarters stuff, and
a board of inch stuff, all sound and clean pine, must
be provided.</p>

<p>And here we may pause for a moment.</p>

<p>We intend to begin our organ by making a set
of wooden pipes. Hence we need not provide
ourselves with more timber for the present than
we shall need for this first operation. But as in
our imaginary furnishing of the workshop, we
included several or many things which belong
rather to future than to immediate use, so we may
here place the reader in a position to form some
idea of the further expense to which he will be put
for the purchase of timber for his proposed small
organ of four or five stops. The pine boards just
enumerated will give us our first set of pipes; but
when these are ready, we shall require some rather
costly wood for the sound-board. This should be
Honduras mahogany, often called "Bay wood,"
and of three thicknesses, say, three-quarters stuff
for the table of the sound-board;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a full inch, or,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>still better, five-quarters, for the upper boards; and
some very thin stuff, three-eighths or less, known
as "coach-panel," for the sliders. The quantities,
or number of square feet, of these mahogany boards
will be determined by considerations discussed in
a subsequent chapter. The wood must be carefully
selected, for the grain of it is often tortuous
and unkindly for the plane; it must be, like the
pine, free from large knots, flaws, and cracks; and
the completeness of its seasoning should be quite
unquestionable and beyond the reach of suspicion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> All these expressions will, of course, be explained hereafter.</p></div>

<p>It is not unreasonable to assume that the reader,
who has contemplated for some time the building
of an organ, has already by him some materials
which he knows will be necessary; for instance,
some boards of sound white deal for the framework,
and perhaps for the bellows; and some
scantlings of red deal, or pitch pine, or oak, or
mahogany, or red cedar, for the blocks and
stoppers of pipes. He will not need the aid of
this book to be aware that old materials may
sometimes be turned to excellent account in such
a business as that upon which he is embarking.
We have known the purchase (for a pound or two)
of an old square pianoforte turn out a profitable
investment. Its mahogany top was solid, not
veneered; and the thin boards found in its interior
dry as touch-wood, and perhaps one hundred years
old, were made into pipes of charming sweetness.</p>

<p>The old organs before the days of mahogany
were made chiefly of oak, often called "wainscot."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
We ourselves have made much use of this durable
and trustworthy material, which may be obtained
in the convenient form known as "coopers' staves,"
being planks about 6 feet in length, as many
inches in width, and 2 or 3 inches thick. They
may be divided, at any saw-pit or saw-mill, into
boards of the desired thinness, and they work
pleasantly under thoroughly sharp tools.</p>

<p>And now we may set to work upon our set of
wood pipes.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c"><i>THE STOPPED DIAPASON.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> do we begin by making a set of wooden
pipes?</p>

<p>For two reasons. First, because they will afford
a trial of patience, and involve a great deal of good
joinery. Second, because until they are made, or,
at any rate, until we know their precise dimensions,
we cannot plot out with accuracy the very important
sound-board, which is to carry them and the
other pipes which are to follow. Either of these
reasons is, to our mind, sufficient, apart from the
other; and we strongly recommend the young
beginner to set himself resolutely to the manufacture
of the complete set of wooden pipes belonging
to the commonest of all organ-stops, the Stopped
Diapason, before taking any step in the direction of
the machinery or apparatus which is to waken
them into harmonious vibrations.</p>

<p>Our explanations will be much assisted here if
we introduce a few definitions of terms in constant
use. The pipes which we are about to make will
give notes, when tuned, which are familiarly
designated by certain names. Thus, the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
note on the manual or key-board of modern organs
is called <i>Double C</i> (printed CC). The note one
octave above this is <i>Tenor C</i>; the octave of Tenor
C is <i>Middle C</i>; and above this, again, we have
<i>Treble C</i> (often called <i>Foot C</i>) and <i>C in Alto</i>. Some
of the other notes of the scale, in a similar way,
have convenient names. Thus, the first F in the
bass is <i>Double F</i>, or FF; the next F, the F of the
Tenor octave, is often called <i>Clef F</i>, as the Bass, or
F Clef, stands upon this line in music; its sharp is
FF sharp; but then we come at once to a single G,
and this note is often called <i>Gamut G</i>. The octave
above this note is called <i>Fiddle G</i>, as it sounds the
same note as the fourth string of the violin. The
note B, we may add, throughout the organ, is
understood to mean <i>B flat</i>; the semitone above
this is indicated by the musical symbol the Natural
(&#9838;).</p>

<p>We have not quite done with this. There is
another way of referring to pipes, and to complete
sets of pipes, which is in familiar use, and is part
of the mother-tongue of the organ-builder. We
have said that Treble C is often called <i>Foot C</i>.
This is because the ordinary open pipe of that note
(speaking now quite inexactly, and without precision),
is 1 foot in length. In a similar way,
CC is 8-<i>foot C</i>, or the 8-<i>foot note</i>, because the open
pipe is 8 feet in length, speaking roundly or
roughly. Tenor C is 4-<i>foot C</i>; Middle C, 2-<i>foot C</i>.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood that these convenient
designations are retained, even though the construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>tion
of the pipes may render them strictly inapplicable.
Thus, the lowest note of our first stop will
still be 8-foot C, though, as we shall soon see, the
stopping of the wooden tube enables us to reduce
the actual length by one-half. Our CC will still
be of 8-<i>feet pitch</i>, or <i>tone</i>, and by no means becomes
a 4-<i>foot</i> C, because its actual measurement, when
completed, will not exceed 4 feet in total length.</p>

<p>One step further. The theoretical length of the
lowest note is not only used to designate that note
and the pipes which belong to that note, but is
extended to the designation of the whole set of
pipes of which it is the lowest or longest. This
whole set of pipes is called familiarly a <i>Stop</i>; thus
we have at once the ready terms, 8-feet stops,
16-feet stops, 4-feet stops, 2-feet stops, &amp;c.; and it
will be understood that by an 8-feet stop, we mean
a set of pipes yielding the common or ordinary
pitch of the pianoforte, or of the human voice;
while a 4-feet stop, when the very same keys are
pressed down, will yield notes one octave higher
than this ordinary or standard pitch; the 2-feet
stop, notes two octaves higher; the 16-feet stop,
notes one octave lower, or deeper. And if all
these four stops are played at the same time,
(tuning and other manipulations being now
assumed), an effect will be produced highly agreeable
to the ear, and vastly superior to that which
would result from the mere multiplication of 8-feet
stops only.</p>

<p>Our little organ of five stops, when completed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
will probably be described with correctness if it is
said to contain two 8-feet stops, two 4-feet stops,
and one 2-foot stop: a ready and conventional
way of speaking, we repeat yet once more, since
the instrument will contain no open pipe 8 feet
in length, and since, of the 4-feet stops, one will
be only of 4-feet tone, or pitch, while even the
2-feet stop, for reasons which will be abundantly
made clear, may possibly have no 2-feet pipe.</p>

<p>Some pains have been taken to explain all this,
because we have met with young workmen whose
comprehension of such rudimentary matters was
far from complete, and who were misled by the
fanciful and wholly unimportant <i>names</i> engraved
upon the knobs which govern the stops, <i>e.g.</i>
"Flute," "Dulciana," &amp;c. If we have any such
young beginners among our present readers, they
will see that the names are quite of secondary
concern, and that the essential thing is to have a
clear understanding of the <i>pitch</i> of each stop, as
represented by the length of the pipe, <i>actual or
virtual</i>, corresponding to the lowest note of the
manual.</p>

<p>And now we proceed to our work. What we
have to do is to make fifty-four pipes, extending
from CC to F in alto, and of the form or sort known
in England as Stopped Diapason. One of these
pipes, let us suppose Tenor C, is shown in Fig. 1.
<i>a</i> is a block of mahogany or oak, or of some other
wood faced with mahogany or oak, and about 3
inches in length. It has a throat or deep depres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>sion
across it, formed by taking out the wood
between two saw-cuts, or by boring adjacent holes
with a centre-bit. <i>b</i> is a stopper, made of any
wood, the exact size of the block, or a trifle less,
to allow for a leather
covering, and fashioned
at top into a knob, or
turned in the lathe, for
convenient handling by
the tuner. <i>c</i> is the pipe
when put together by
gluing three boards,
namely, the back and
the two sides, to the
block, and one, namely
the front board, to the
edges of the sides. This
fourth board is about
3 inches shorter than the
others, and has a lip
formed on its lower edge
by bevelling the wood with a sharp chisel. <i>d</i> is a
cap, 3 inches long, and as wide as the block with
the side boards attached; it is hollowed in a
wedge-shaped form as shown in the figure. <i>e</i> is a
foot, turned in the lathe, bored from end to end,
and 5 or 6 inches in length. <i>f</i> is the completed
pipe, with the stopper inserted, the cap put on, and
the foot in its place.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="illus2">
<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>We have to make fifty-four such pipes, each of
the dimensions proper for the production of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
own note, deep in the bass or shrill in the
treble.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that we must not work by "rule
of thumb," but understand well what we are about
from the very first, if we do not wish to cut our wood
to waste and cover ourselves with mortification.</p>

<p>Begin thus. Take a sheet of stout paper, and on
it, with rule and compasses, draw a scale showing
all the requisite measurements.</p>

<p>Here we must be a little arbitrary, and lay down
the law without giving lengthy reasons for our
ruling. Stopped pipes are half the length of open
pipes yielding the same notes. Our CC pipe will
therefore be 4 feet long. The four C's of the
ascending scale are the halves of each other.
Therefore Tenor C will be 2 feet, Middle C 1 foot,
Treble C 6 inches, and C in alto 3 inches, in length.
The word <i>nearly</i>, or <i>about</i>, must be understood as
prefixed in every case to our measurements. Accordingly,
the lengths of all the pipes in the stop
will be easily obtained by drawing a vertical line
1 foot in length on the paper, and dividing it into
twelve equal parts. At the bottom, write Tenor C,
2 feet; at the top, Middle C, 1 foot. Then the
length of each of the eleven pipes intervening
between these extremes will be at once obtained by
easy measurement. By doubling these lengths we
shall obtain those of the bass, or 8-feet octave. By
halving them, those of the middle octave. By
dividing them by four, we get those of the treble
octave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Note well that these rough and approximate
lengths are speaking lengths of the wooden tubes,
or, in other words, of the column of air within them,
measured from the top of the block to the under
side of the stopper. Hence, in cutting out the
boards, the length of the block&mdash;about 3 inches, or
less in small pipes&mdash;must be added to three of them,
and an inch or more allowed to all four of them to
give good room for the stopper.</p>

<p>But we are not yet in a position to cut out the
boards.</p>

<p>It might be thought that as we get the lengths by
the easy arithmetical process described above, so
with equal ease shall we get the widths and depths
of the blocks. The pipes are not square, but are
deeper than they are wide, in the proportion of
about 5 to 4. It might be thought that if the block
of Tenor C be 2 inches wide and 2&#189; inches deep,
then the block of Middle C will be 1 inch by
1&#188; inches; the block of Foot C &#189; inch by &#8541;, and so
on. This is not so. These treble pipes would be
quite unreasonably small, and would give weak
and thin sounds, while the bass octave, commencing
with a block 4 inches by 5 inches, would
be needlessly large for a chamber organ. Without
wasting words upon a matter which is really very
simple, let us say at once that we shall adopt for our
Stopped Diapason a scale commencing with a CC
block 3&#188; inches wide and 4 inches deep, and that
the block of Tenor C will be 2&#8539; inches wide and
2&#8541; deep. Thus the half of the width and depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the CC block will not be reached until the
eighteenth note above it, instead of the thirteenth,
and in the higher parts of the scale the diminution
in the sizes of the blocks may be yet more gradual.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>A glance at Fig. 2 will enable our readers to
draw scales for themselves for the Stopped
Diapason, and for other wooden stops which may
follow it, from a few given data, and to suit cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>cumstances.
A minute or Chinese accuracy is not
requisite. The vertical line of any convenient
length being drawn upon the paper, the width and
depth of the CC block are measured off upon a
horizontal line drawn at its lower extremity.
Eighteen divisions being marked upon the vertical
line, the half-width and half-depth of the CC block
are measured upon another horizontal line drawn
at the eighteenth mark. These points being joined
by straight lines, and horizontal lines being drawn
at each of the marks parallel to the others, we shall
have the widths and depths of the blocks of all the
pipes from CC to Clef F inclusive, viz. eighteen
blocks. The next eighteen blocks will be sized in
a precisely similar manner, and as three times
eighteen is equal to fifty-four, the whole stop may
be divided into three sections of eighteen pipes in
each section, and it may be for our convenience to
make one section at a time.</p>

<p>There are two methods of working together the
block and the four boards which form the pipe.
We will give them both, and decide between them.</p>

<p>First method. Cut out the board for the back,
and dress it carefully to the exact width of the
block. Glue the block to the lower extremity, and
when the glue is dry dress up all perfectly flush.
Cut out the side boards as wide as the depth of the
block with the thickness of the back board added
to it. Glue them to the sides of the block and to
the edges of the backboard, obtaining a perfectly
close joint by using wooden clamps and wedges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as in gluing up a violin, or by other obvious contrivances.
When the glue is dry dress up the
front edges flush with the block, and glue on the
front board, which will be cut out as wide as the
block together with the thicknesses of the side
boards. The front board must overlap the
upper edge of the block by about &#8539; inch or
more. If all this is carefully done according to the
rules of good joinery the result should be a neat
and strong pipe, truly rectangular at its upper or
open extremity. Brads or sprigs are not to be
thought of in pipe-making, unless, indeed, in the
very exceptional case of organs intended for tropical
climates.</p>

<p>Second method. Cut out first the two side
boards the width of the depth of the block, and
glue them to it. Dress the edges flush with the
block, and glue on at once the back and front
boards, obtaining irreproachable joints as before,
and taking infinite care that the upper extremities
of the side boards do not approach each other. In
making our smaller pipes (say from Middle C
upwards), we are in the habit of straining whip-cord
or stout hempen string round them, winding
it first upon a loose pipe-foot or smooth tool-handle
to avoid cutting the hands; and we ensure
a correct aperture at the top by placing within it a
thin slice cut from the block itself, or by introducing
the stopper if it has been already prepared
of the same size as the block. The notches made
by the string upon the edges of the soft pine-wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
are easily removed when the finished pipe is
dressed over with a fine plane.</p>

<p>We have no difficulty in giving our decision in
favour of the second plan, which avoids the four
tedious dryings of the glue, and which admits
more readily of pressure being applied to the
freshly glued joints. But in making open pipes,
which have not to bear the driving-in of a stopper,
there is much to recommend the first method.</p>

<p>This point being settled, we may cut out the
side boards and prepare the blocks for one of our
divisions, let us say the middle section, from Clef F
sharp to the natural below Foot C. Blocks of this
moderate size will be best made by taking a piece
of wood of suitable character, long enough for six
or more, and by dressing it down as each block is
cut off, making careful and constant use of the
gauge, the square, and the callipers. We like to
form the throat with a centre-bit after the pipe is
put together. The thirty-six boards will be glued
to the eighteen blocks, and while the glue is drying
we can prepare the backs and fronts. The
bevelled lip of the latter will be left uncut until all
the pipes have been glued up and dressed over,
and the top edges nicely cleaned off and made
true. But as there will be, doubtless, a most
pardonable anxiety to hear the sound of one pipe,
we will here explain that the height of the mouth
of each pipe must be equal to one-third of its width;
thus the mouth of the pipe measuring one inch
and a half across the block (A in our scale) will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
be &#189; inch in height. In measuring the height of
the mouths, a pair of proportional compasses with
sliding centre, or common dividers set to thirds,
fourths, and fifths, will be useful if not necessary.
The slope of the bevel is not of great importance.
Cut it with a sharp chisel, taking care not to injure
the block, and leave the lower edge or lip rather
blunt. A sharp and pointed knife may be employed
in cutting the lip truly, guided by the
square. The use of fine glass-paper is permissible
here to smooth all these parts nicely.</p>

<p>The throat having been formed in the face of the
block, about 1 inch from its lower end, bore the
foot-hole in the bottom of the block clear into the
throat, beginning with a small borer, and enlarging
the hole cautiously, as rough and hasty proceedings
might split the block at this point, especially in
the case of small pipes.</p>

<p>Prepare the cap from a suitable bit of mahogany,
oak, or other close-grained wood, and hollow out
the back of it with a chisel as shown in <i>d</i>, Fig. 1.
Form the flue or wind-way through which the
air is to pass to the lip by filing away the edge
left at the top of the wedge-shaped hollow,
trying your work by placing the cap against the
side of the pipe or any other flat surface. The
flue must not be wider than 1&frasl;16 inch at Tenor C,
and must be reduced as we ascend the scale until
it will hardly admit a slip of thin paper. It will
not be so much as &#8539; inch wide even at CC.</p>

<p>Perhaps the stopper has been already prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the same size as the block, and has been formed
into a knob at top, or turned in the lathe, or, in the
case of the larger pipes, fitted with a turned handle
glued into a hole bored for its reception. Dress
off the angles of the stopper in order to allow room
for the soft white leather with which it is covered
to fold itself in the corners of the pipe. We generally
rasp our stoppers, leaving them rough that
the leather may cling to the stopper and not to the
pipe. The leather cannot be too thin if it is soft,
and if the stopper fits closely. Rub the interior of
the top of the pipe with a bit of tallow-candle, and
introduce the stopper cautiously. It should slide
within the pipe at once easily and with accurate
fit, and if your joinery has been good there should
be no fear of splitting the pipe or of opening the
joints.</p>

<p>The cap when finally fitted will have its upper
edge about &#8539; inch below the upper edge of the
block. On applying it in this position, holding
it there with your fingers, or tying it on with
string, and blowing gently into the foot-hole,
you will have a pleasant fluty musical note.
Probably a little chirp or whistle will be heard
before the note comes on. The removal of this
defect belongs to the important operation called
<i>voicing</i>, of which we shall treat hereafter.</p>

<p>We have cut our boards from the half-inch pine,
but as we rise in the scale much thinner stuff will
be used. It is well to foresee this in laying in our
materials. Red cedar, often used by cabinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>makers
for the inside of drawers and wardrobes,
makes very pretty pipes, holds the glue well, and
has an agreeable odour in working. Harder
woods, notably oak, were often used by the old
builders. Pear-tree commends itself much in
German workshops.</p>

<p>The four or five lowest pipes (CC to EE, or
higher) should be of stouter stuff than half-inch,
say five-eighths or even three-quarters. The caps
of these large pipes will not be glued on but fixed
with three screws, and we may modify a previous
remark by admitting that in the case of these
larger pipes the use of nails is legitimate.</p>

<p>Of the pipe-feet we shall speak when we come
to the business of planning the rack-board
with its holes for their reception.</p>

<p>We must not close this chapter
without giving some further explanations
on the subject of pipe-making.</p>

<p>Large pipes, both open and stopped,
may be advantageously made with
<i>languids</i> instead of blocks. Fig. 3
shows the section of a pipe so made.
The block is replaced by two pieces
of suitable wood, <i>a a</i>, let into the side
boards with plenty of glue. The glue
should also be allowed to run freely
into the angles and corners of the
throat when the back board is fitted. Pipes made in
this way are a little lighter than those with blocks.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The stoppers of the smaller pipes, say from
Fiddle G or Middle C to top, are often bored with
a hole passing clear through the wood and leather,
and burnt smooth with an iron. After what has
been said of the necessity of securing a good fit for
the stopper, it might be thought that this hole
would ruin the pipe. Curiously enough it is not
so, but imparts a slight increase of fulness to the
tone. The holes must not be large, &#188; inch at
Middle C will be sufficient. Note well that pipes
with perforated stoppers must be a trifle longer,
say 1 inch in 12, than those completely closed.
Thus the pipe for C sharp must be as long as the
fully stopped C pipe.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes are also made with inverted
mouths, that is to say, the bevelled
lip is formed on the inside instead of
on the outside of the front board. In
this case the bevel is cut and the
mouth measured and formed before
the pipe is put together, and the front
board will be of the same length as
the others, and will be glued like them
to the block. The throat is cut
through the board into the block, and
the cap will project beyond the level
of the board. All this is shown in
Fig. 4.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/fig7.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>We have a very charming Stopped
Diapason made in this way, and with
perforated stoppers, in one of our organs. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
is of red cedar from Middle C to top; the
lower part is of pine and of the ordinary construction.
The mouths are in the proportion of
two-sevenths of the width of each pipe. Inverted
mouths are well suited, also, to the Clarabella
and Hohl Fl√∂te, two kindred stops which sometimes
take the place of the Stopped Diapason
in its upper octaves. The pipes are open, and
have a hollow penetrating tone; Middle C is 2 feet
long, and its block may be of the same size as that
of the same note in our scale, namely, <i>about</i> 1&#8540; by
1&#190;. The mouth about 2&frasl;7 of the width. These open
pipes are tuned by means of shades, which are
pieces of pipe metal let into a saw-cut made in the
top edge of the back board. The shade must be as
wide as the pipe, and &#189; inch longer than its
depth. The pipe is flattened by bending the shade
over the open top, sharpened by raising it.</p>

<p>The German stop, the Doppel-fl√∂te, which has
two mouths opposite to each other, and of course
two caps for each pipe, is seldom or never heard in
this country. A few pipes which we have made as
experiments hardly seem to repay us for the additional
trouble and labour.</p>

<p>Trouble and labour were of little account,
apparently, in the old days of English organ-building
two centuries ago, if we may judge from the
really marvellous specimens of patient pipe-making
in wood which have come down to us. We ourselves
have seen and played organs of exquisite
sweetness and beauty by old Bernhard Schmidt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
(1660-1708), containing four or five stops in which
every pipe was of oak, even up to the top note of
a Fifteenth of 2 feet. Such an organ, built by
Loosemore, 1664, the builder of the cathedral
organ, is preserved, we believe, at Exeter. It has
six stops, including a Twelfth, all made of wood.
Modern life is too hasty and impetuous for such
efforts. If any of our readers, however, should set
themselves the task of making very small pipes in
wood, we advise them to form the block and foot
from one piece, and to follow the first method <a href="#Page_18">(see
p. 18)</a> in putting the minute contrivance together.</p>

<p class="c"><i>THE SOUND-BOARD.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> may fairly assume that no one will embark
upon the very serious business of building an
organ, and that probably no one will read this
book, who has not sufficient previous knowledge of
the subject to understand what is meant by the
expressions sound-board, wind-chest, pallets,
sliders.</p>

<p>It may be taken as certain, moreover, that the
reader who takes up this book to assist him in the
arduous work which he has undertaken, and in the
hope (which we trust we shall not disappoint) of
finding rules laid down in it which he can readily
reduce to practice, has long ago decided upon the
position which the projected organ is to occupy,
and has measured with his eye, if not with his two-foot
rule or tape, the breadth, depth, and height
which can be fairly allowed to the finished instrument.</p>

<p>Great diversity of dimension and design is one
of the peculiarities which distinguish organs from
all other musical instruments. Our organ may be
wide and shallow like a book-case, or it may be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
little greater width than its key-board, but deep
like a wardrobe; it may be carried up nearly to
the ceiling of a lofty apartment, or may be kept
down to suit the low-browed rafters of a country
farmhouse or a workman's cottage.</p>

<p>The site chosen for the organ may allow of convenient
access to the back of it for tuning purposes;
or it may compel us to arrange the interior
so that the back may always remain in close contact
with the wall. The projection of the keys, too,
from the front, and therefore the position of the
player when seated at the instrument, possibly in
a small room; the place for the blowing-handle
and for the person who works it, so that convenient
space may be left for him to fulfil his
irksome duty&mdash;these are matters of detail admitting
of great variety of treatment.</p>

<p>There are cases in which it may be possible, and
very advantageous, to separate the bellows from
the organ which they supply, and to establish
them in an adjoining room, or beneath the floor
or platform on which the organ is placed.</p>

<p>All these considerations must receive full attention,
and drawings or rough sketches sufficiently
intelligible to the workman himself must be made
in accordance with the decisions arrived at. Then,
and not till then, we can launch ourselves upon
the very serious business of designing and constructing
the sound-board.</p>

<p>A serious business, we say, making a large
demand upon our industry and perseverance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
calling for adroit use of tools of several different
characters.</p>

<p>To facilitate our own task in describing the process
of constructing a sound-board, we shall divide
this chapter into short sections, with intervening
remarks.</p>

<p>1. The sound-board is a shallow box, divided
internally into as many transverse grooves or
channels as there are notes on the key-board.
The pipes stand upon holes bored through the top
of the box into these channels; and it is plain that
if air is made to fill these channels, and to issue
from these holes in a constant stream when we
please, all the pipes which stand upon the holes
will give their sounds according to their pitch and
character.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;Thus if one channel, say the channel
corresponding to Tenor C, have five holes bored
into it through the top of the box, then five pipes
standing upon those holes may be made to speak
at once, or in chorus, by pressing down the one
key on the manual.</p>

<p>2. It is plain that we must possess the power of
opening and closing these holes in sets or classes
at our pleasure, so that the air may be directed
into those pipes which we desire to hear, while
others are silent. The top of the box is therefore
made double, or of two layers of wood; and
between the two layers long strips of thin wood
are introduced, lying lengthwise, that is to say, at
right angles to the channels beneath or within.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The holes are bored down through all these three
layers of wood forming the top of the box; and we
see that by sliding the thin slip an inch or so to
the right or left, we can cut off at once the current
of air from the pipes standing on those holes, since
the apertures in the three layers will then no
longer coincide.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;All this is quite independent of, and
preliminary to, the arrangements for admitting
the supply of air to the channels themselves.</p>

<p>3. Having already made our Stopped Diapason
pipes, let us range them on a table or floor, and
consider well how they must be planted on a
sound-board such as we are about to make for our
organ, be it broad and shallow, or narrow and
deep, be it low or lofty.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;No other stop will practically take up
so much room on the sound-board as the Stopped
Diapason; hence, if we plot the board with reference
to it, all the other pipes will be easily
worked in.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig8.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>4. On the opposite page several different plantations
of the Stopped Diapason are shown both in
elevation and in plan. In Fig. 5 the pipes, planted
in a double row throughout, are placed alternately
to the right and to the left, meeting in the middle
at the smallest pipe. The exact reverse of this
plantation, namely, placing the largest pipes in the
middle, and sloping down to the smallest pipes at
each end, can be easily imagined, and it is unnecessary
to figure it. It is clear that in both these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>plantations the large pipes occupy a space, as
regards depth, out of proportion to the space occupied
by the upper part of the stop. Fig. 6 shows a
very common plantation of pipes, which, as we
shall see hereafter, allows us to simplify the internal
mechanism or action. Fig. 7, in plan only, shows
a mode of economising space as regards depth by
planting the pipes of the lower octave in a single
row, resuming the double row at Tenor C. This
plantation would suit a wide and shallow organ.
Figs. 8 and 9 show different methods of planting
the large pipes in order to avoid a disproportionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>sacrifice of space on the board. It will be seen at a
glance that they can be ranged behind the pipes of
the tenor and treble octaves, or carried off to the
right and left in rows standing at right angles to
them. Fig. 10, in elevation only, shows how we
may build an organ under the ceiling of a very low
room, by planting the eight feet octave on a board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of its own at a lower level than that of the sound-board
proper. And it is easy to conceive, without
a figure, that this accessory board may be replaced
by two boards, to right and left, resulting in a plan
resembling that in Fig. 9, but giving a lower level
to the tall pipes.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;We confess to a strong liking for these
later plantations, which require some little careful
mechanical adaptations, but result in a compact
arrangement, admitting of enclosure in a case of
graceful outline.</p>

<div class="figlefta">
<img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 10.</p>
</div>

<p>5. We have still some considerations requiring
careful attention before we can map out our sound-board.
The plantation of the pipes will be the
chief guide to the planning of the channels, with
the divisions or spaces between them; but it must
not be forgotten that the boring of the holes for the
supply of air must be done in regular lines within
spaces or widths easily covered by the sliders. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
slider is seldom more than from 2 to 3 inches
wide; there are good reasons why this width
cannot conveniently be much exceeded. But the
feet of the large pipes in the bass octave will be as
much as 5 inches or more apart when the pipes
are planted back to back,
as in Figs. 5 and 6. Hence
we must decide, before we
begin to work, not only
how the pipes are to stand
on the board, but how they
are to get their wind and
be deprived of it by the
action of a slider of the
usual width. Perhaps we
shall resolve to run two
narrow sliders under the
foot-holes of the whole
stop, one for each of the
two rows, controlling both
sliders by a single knob or
handle. By this method
every pipe will stand on its
wind, as the workmen say,
that is, will be in direct and uninterrupted communication
with the channel when the holes are open.
Or possibly it may suit our plans better to run two
sliders under the feet of the bass pipes, and a third
between them, under the rest of the stop; all three,
be it well understood, extending from end to end
of the sound-board, but having holes only at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
proper places, and being blank elsewhere: these
three sliders being governed by one knob, or by
two, if the stop is to draw in halves (as it is called),
that is, as a separate Bass and Treble. Or, once
again, we may use a single slider for the whole stop,
but carry the wind through grooves fashioned in the
solid wood from the holes bored in the usual way to
the points at which the pipes are planted. And,
lastly, we may carry the wind from the holes to pipes
planted in any position, and practically at any distance
by tubes made of pipe-metal or other material.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;It need hardly be said that an examination
of the interior of a well-built organ will be
of great service to the beginner who is planning
his first sound-board.</p>

<p>6. The dimensions, then, and character of the
sound-board having been determined after full consideration
of the site for the organ, and a drawing
or sketch having been made for your own guidance,
proceed thus:&mdash;Take a board of good clean bay-wood,
&#189;, &#8541;, or &#190; inch in thickness, and long
enough and wide enough to form the "table" or
top of your work; and dress this carefully until one
of its surfaces is quite true and level. This dressed
or levelled side is to be the lower or under side,
and we are about to form upon it the grooves or
channels of which it will ultimately form the roof.
Next prepare a ruler or straight edge of any thin
stuff, and on this, with compasses, rule, and square,
guided by plenty of deliberate consideration, mark
the size and place of each of the grooves, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the bar of wood which will divide each groove from
its neighbour, from end to end. You will find, of
course, and you were previously aware, that the
widths of the grooves and the thickness of the
bars will vary in proportion to their place in the
scale. Let us say at once that &#190; inch will be
ample width for the CC groove in our small organ;
and let us advise that the smallest groove in the
treble be about &#188; inch in width, and that the
bars between these narrow grooves be at least
&#8540; or &#189; inch in thickness, in order to allow a good
seat or margin for the pallets or valves which are
to govern the admission of the wind. In the bass
the bars will be very much thicker than this, or
not, according to the plan which you have adopted.
The part of your rule in which you will soon perceive
that the chief danger of crowding your pipes
will arise is the tenor octave. Refer carefully to
your pipes, and be quite sure before you mark your
ruler, that you are allowing room for Tenor C and
its neighbours to stand clear of each other when
they are planted on the completed board. Having
satisfied yourself on these points, prepare your
bars from sound pine-wood, planing them with
care, and especially seeing that the edge of each
bar is truly square with its sides. Two inches will
be an ample width for each bar, in other words,
an ample depth for each groove when completed.
Their length will of course be equal to the width
of the table, less an inch or so, according to the
construction now to be described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>There are now two methods of proceeding. First
method:&mdash;The table being turned over, with the
dressed side uppermost, your ruler well in sight,
with plenty of hot and fresh glue fix your first thick
bar at or near either end of the table. We say, "or
<i>near</i> either end," because you may like to leave
room for a finishing cheek of mahogany when all
the bars are put in. The second bar will be glued
to the table in like manner, the proper distance
from the first being secured by "filling-in pieces"
of wood of the exact thickness, glued between the
bars at their ends. This alternation of bars and
fillings-in will be continued until all the grooves
have been formed according to your ruler; the
rough ends of the bars will then be dressed with a
sharp plane, and neat cheeks of stout bay-wood will
be glued on all the four sides of the divided box
which you have thus built up. Second method:&mdash;Prepare
the bay-wood cheeks first, and in the two
long ones, using a fine saw and small chisel, cut
grooves to receive the ends of the bars. Form a
shallow box by gluing these bay-wood sides and
ends to the table. The corners need not be dovetailed,
but an equally close joint must be secured if
dovetailing is omitted. Then introduce the bars,
using an abundance of hot glue, and taking care
that no bar fits so tightly between the cheeks as to
risk bending. When all the bars are glued in, add
more thin glue within each groove, placing the
sound-board in a sloping position that the glue
may run into the angles, and afterwards reversing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the board to the opposite slope, repeating the
coating of thin glue.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;This unusual profusion of glue is to
preclude the possibility of air making its way from
one groove to the adjacent one bypassing between
the edge of the bar and the table; and what is
here said applies equally to both methods.</p>

<p>We ourselves prefer the second method to the
first. M. Hamel, in his wonderfully accurate and
minute treatise, describes a third, in which the
fillings-in are avoided. Those to whom his book is
accessible cannot fail to share the present writer's
admiration of his marvellous industry, and of his
great gift of clear and precise description of mechanical
processes. Hopkins and Rimbault may
also be consulted with much advantage.</p>

<p>7. The work, thus glued up, must be left in a
dry room for two or three days, until all is perfectly
set and hard. Meanwhile the other pieces of which
the completed sound-board will consist are being
cut out and prepared. We shall want the upper
boards, the sliders, and the slips of wood (<i>false
sliders</i> the French builders call them, while in
England they are termed <i>bearers</i>) which divide
these from each other.</p>

<p>We may safely suppose that if the ordinary form
of sound-board has been chosen&mdash;such, for instance,
as that which is shown in Fig. 6&mdash;its size will be
about 4 feet, or 6 inches more, in length. Its width
will depend on the number of stops for which it is
planned, and therefore of sliders which are to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
on the table; if we are to have five stops, about
15 inches may be taken as the probable width, but
this may be less, or more, according to the class
of stops selected, and the arrangement chosen for
their bass pipes. To give accurate measurements
in feet and inches for all the parts of the sound-board
would only mislead our readers at this stage
of our labours. We give general rules only: it
must rest with the reader himself, as we have now
abundantly reminded him, to decide on the shape
of his sound-board and to make the plantation
of his pipes, and the consequent arrangement of
grooves and sliders conformable thereto.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, quite arbitrarily, and independently
of all special considerations, that the sound-board
is 4 feet long and 15 inches wide, we may
cut out the upper boards from sound and clean
bay-wood, 1&#188; inch thick. Cut them 6 inches longer
than the sound-board. And now as to width. As
there are five stops, and five sliders for them, are
we to understand that we shall have also five upper
boards? To this we reply, by no means. Our
stops, we assume, will be two of 8 feet, two of
4 feet, and one of 2 feet. For reasons which we
shall soon give, we shall propose to have one upper
board for each of these three divisions: that for the
8-feet stops being 7 inches wide, that for the 4 feet
5 inches, and for the 2 feet 3 inches. Under
the 7-inch board there will be two sliders, each
2 inches in width; under the 5-inch, two sliders,
each 1&#189; inch in width; and under the 3-inch, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
slider, 1&#188; inch wide. The bearers will be thus:&mdash;The
two outside bearers, that is, those which extend
along the front and back margins of the sound-board,
to be 1&#188; inch in width; the second bearer
(reckoning from the back) to be 1 inch; the third
to be 1&#189; inch, because it will lie beneath the line
of junction, or rather of division, between the two
wider upper boards; the fourth bearer may be
&#189; inch only, being merely a separation between the
next two sliders; the fifth may be 1&#188; inch, falling
as it does under a line of division; the sixth is
similar to the first. It will thus be seen that we
have&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;All this is so important that we have
shown the measurements drawn to scale in Fig. 11.</p>

<p>Cut out the sliders and bearers from perfectly
clean sound bay-wood or red cedar boards, not
more than &#8540; inch in thickness. Having turned
your sound-board over, with the table uppermost,
assemble all the pieces, and satisfy yourself that
your measurements are correct, and that so far
there is no error in your plans. See that all your
planes are in first-rate order, and set yourself in
earnest to bring to a perfectly level and true sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>face
the table or top of the sound-board, and one
side of the sliders and bearers. No pains must be
spared to render the surface of the table absolutely
true. Apply a "straight edge" rubbed with
chalk, moving it in various directions, and use
unwearied diligence in removing all inequalities
detected by this means. Take care, too, that there
is no "winding." In short, adopt all the means
which the rules of good joinery give you for producing
a surface faultlessly level. This done,
arrange upon the table, with their planed sides
downwards, your sliders and bearers, and pin them
down upon it with very small brads, piercing
through near their edges. In doing this have
regard to the grain of the wood, as you are about
to dress the upper surfaces. Sink the brads well
out of the way of the plane with a punch, and bring
the sliders and bearers to a true level as you did
the table.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Scale, two-thirds of an inch to a foot.<br /> Fig. 11.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;M. Hamel advises that in making the
sound-board the table should be left 3 inches
longer at each end than the actual box beneath,
expressly to afford a bearing for the ends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sliders during this business of planing them. If
this suggestion is not followed, the projecting ends
of the sliders will require separate attention.</p>

<p>The three upper boards may now be brought
down upon the finished sliders and bearers, and a
couple of iron pins or dowels may be let into each
of them and into the bearers and table beneath,
near their extremities, for the purpose of confining
them temporarily in the exact places which they
are to occupy. Dress over now the upper sides of
the three boards, which do not, however, require
attention to absolute truth.</p>

<p>8. We cannot yet bore the holes for the pipes.
Before we can do so we must prepare yet another
board or boards of clean pine, &#8541; or &#190; inch thick, 4
feet 6 inches long, and 15 inches wide, for the
rack boards through which the pipe-feet are to
pass, and which are to maintain the pipes in an
upright position. If you have two upper boards
the division should occur between those of the
8-feet and 4-feet stops. Pin down your rack-board
upon the upper boards with brads here and there
near the edges.</p>

<p>Let us now consider for a moment. We have
made our box of fifty-four transverse channels or
grooves, and its top consists now of four layers of
wood&mdash;namely, the table, the sliders, the upper
boards, and the rack-boards. Through these four
layers of wood, at the proper places, are to be
bored holes of various sizes clear through into the
channels; but it is plain that the holes in the rack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>-boards
will always be much larger than those in
the three other layers, because the rack-boards are
to be ultimately raised about 5 inches above the
upper board on legs or pins, and will therefore
receive the thick part of the conical pipe-feet,
while the holes in the upper board will only
receive their tip or small extremity. But the
centres of the large holes in the rack-board must
coincide accurately with the centres of the small
holes beneath, and we shall therefore proceed to
mark the exact spots where each of the holes will
commence.</p>

<p>By the aid of your marked rule, trace a line on
the front and back cheeks of the sound-board,
showing the centre of each groove. From these
points draw lines across the rack-boards. It is
evident that all holes bored through the four
layers of wood at any point in any of these lines
must terminate in a channel. Draw lines at right
angles to the last, showing the widths of the sliders
and bearers; it will then be further evident that we
cannot easily get wrong in boring the holes so
that they may penetrate the sliders at the exact
points intended. But the actual boring, with
certain consequences or contingencies belonging
thereto, must be reserved for the next chapter.</p>

<p>The pipes of No. 1, being the tallest in the
organ, will be planted nearest to the back; all the
others, occupying the successive sliders, will present
a gradation of heights agreeable to the eye
and convenient for the tuner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 1, we say, is the tallest in the organ; but be
it carefully observed that in our small instrument it
will not be carried down to its lowest note CC,
which would be 8 feet in speaking length; it will
not descend lower than tenor C, 4 feet, and the last
or lowest twelve notes or sounds will be obtained
by using the corresponding pipes of the Stopped
Diapason as a bass for both stops.</p>

<p>This will be done by "grooving;" and it will
now be seen why, in cutting out the upper boards,
we were careful to have a single board for the
pipes of 8-feet pitch, and another single board for
those of 4-feet pitch. For it is plain that by boring
holes through the upper board, sliders, and table
into any groove of the sound-board, and by connecting
these holes together by means of another deep
groove or score cut in the wood of the upper board,
and then covered in with an air-tight covering, we
obtain a secondary channel, supplied with air by
<i>either or both</i> of the sliders at pleasure; and by
boring one hole through the air-tight covering,
and planting a pipe on that hole, that pipe will
speak whenever a connection is made between
the secondary channel on which it stands and the
main channel or groove below, which is receiving
air at the moment from the bellows.</p>

<p>Clearly, therefore, if we bore holes through the
upper boards and sliders of Nos. 1 and 2 into the
twelve grooves of the bass octave, and then connect
these twelve pairs of holes by cutting upper grooves
in the surface of the boards, covering them in by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
thin boards of wood well glued down, we have then
only to plant our twelve largest stopped pipes on
twelve new holes bored in these thin boards last
mentioned, and we have at once a bass common to
both stops, and each of the two stops will be practically,
and for ordinary purposes, complete down to
the lowest note when its slider is drawn. When
both sliders are drawn, the secondary groove will
receive air from both holes in the upper board;
but this will not have the effect of over-blowing the
pipe, since the <i>pressure</i> or <i>weight</i> of the air remains
the same, and since the pipe can only receive the
quantity of air which is permitted to pass through
the aperture in its foot.</p>

<p>It will now be seen why we did not at once bore
the holes, or rather mark their places, on the rack-board.
Plainly, we must make these twelve
grooves first, and cover them in. Then, replacing
the rack-board as before, carefully mark on the
latter the exact place of each bass pipe, as it will
stand on any part of its secondary groove. Afterwards,
with a bradawl or other sharp-pointed
borer, prick quite through the rack-board at every
one of the points which you have marked throughout
its whole extent. At these points there will
hereafter be circular holes of various sizes for the
reception of the pipe-feet, but in the upper boards,
sliders, and tables there will be smaller holes,
adapted for conveying its stream of air to each
pipe. Before removing the rack-board, decide
upon the places where the rack-pins, or pillars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
which will hold the rack-board up above the sound-board,
are to be. Have plenty of these, say six or
eight if you have a single rack-board, or five to
each if you have two, in order to insure a firm
plantation of the pipes, and bore holes for them
with a centre-bit, say &#8541; diameter, through the
rack-board and to the depth of 1 inch in the
upper boards.</p>

<p>The rack-board now being put aside for the
present, all the holes may be bored through the
upper boards, sliders, and table with bits of
various sizes. From what has been said above
it will be seen that it is not the sizes of these
holes, but of the apertures in the pipe-feet, which
regulate the volumes of wind supplied to the pipes;
but you will, of course, use bits proportioned to the
pipes you have in view. The upper, or treble,
holes must not let the little pipes slip into them,
nor must the larger holes throttle or check the flow
of the wind. In the bass the holes may be as
large as the grooves will allow; and if these are
narrow, or if there is secondary grooving or conducting,
it will be well to cut the round hole at its
interior aperture with a sharp chisel into a square
or rectangular opening; or to bore two round holes
and connect them by taking out the intervening
wood. Afterwards, with iron rods of various sizes,
heated to redness, scorch all the holes through the
three thicknesses of wood, leaving a clear and
smooth charred passage for the wind.</p>

<p>We have not yet done with grooving. This seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to be the proper place for pointing out how the use
of this system may further assist us in the arrangement
of an organ.</p>

<p>Our bass pipes, we have said above, may be
planted on holes cut <i>in any part</i> of the covering or
roof of their respective secondary channels. It
follows readily from this that the secondary groove
or channel may be extended or prolonged for the
express purpose of locating the pipes in situations
convenient for them. Quite apart from any necessity
which may exist for supplying a common bass
to two or more sliders, we may evidently plant our
larger pipes almost where and how we please by
cutting grooves in the substance of the upper
board, extending from the table beneath to the point
where we wish the pipe to be. So long as the
holes are of sufficient diameter and the grooves
of ample dimensions, the wind will reach a pipe
located at a distance even of 2 or 3 feet from its
source of supply without any appreciable interval
between the impact of the finger on the key and
the production of the sound; and the grooves may
be curved almost as we please, though sharp angles
should be avoided.</p>

<p>Even if, in consequence of alterations of original
plans or other circumstances, the upper boards
should not be of sufficient thickness or size to admit
of grooving, we may still avail ourselves of this convenient
system by using an additional or supplementary
upper board, which we will here call a
conducting board, screwed down upon the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
upper board, and containing the grooves. To fix
the exact places for the holes in the under side of the
conducting board, corresponding with those in the
table, spread a sheet of white paper over the upper
board at the part where the conducting is to be,
making the edges or corners of the paper coincide
with those of the board, and rub the paper with the
finger so as to take clear impressions of the holes;
then transfer the paper to the under side of the
conducting board, guided by the edges and corners
as above, and prick out on this under side the
centres of the circular impressions made on the
paper. It is evident that when the conducting
board is applied to the upper board, edges and
corners coinciding as before, these punctured
marks will be exactly over the wind holes in the
table. The holes in the upper side of the conducting
board will be marked as before from the rack-board,
and grooves cut and roofed in with thin
wood, as previously described.</p>

<p>Note further, that the grooving may be, if necessary,
on both sides of the upper boards. All that
is needful in such case is, that after the grooves on
the under sides, next the sliders, are cut, the <i>whole
of the board</i>, and not merely the grooved part of it,
shall be covered or veneered with thin stuff. This
must be dressed perfectly true, as in the case of the
solid or ungrooved board, and all the holes will be
bored through it. The upper sides will also have
a neater appearance if the roofing of thin mahogany
or cedar is carried over its entire surface. Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
boards so treated are, in fact, compounded of three
layers of wood, a central thick slab containing
the grooves, and two coverings or veneers. The
gluing on of these latter must, of course, be very
sound and effectual in every part, or a running of
wind might ensue&mdash;a most provoking and really
fatal defect, incurable without complete reconstruction.</p>

<p>Short grooves may be made by boring holes with
a centre-bit in the <i>edges</i> of the upper boards, and
making the wind-hole beneath and the pipe-hole
above communicate with this concealed tunnel.
On plugging up the external aperture in the edge
of the board, or on stopping a whole row of such
apertures by gluing a band of leather, parchment,
or thick paper over them, it is clear that the wind
will pass to the pipes at pleasure. All such holes
and channels must be scorched with hot irons. To
the true joiner this may seem an unworkmanlike
expedient, but it is necessary to prevent the weakening
of the currents of air which would ensue from
friction against rough surfaces, and to preclude the
risk of carrying tiny chips and particles of wood
into the pipes. If conducting boards are used, they
should be faced with soft white leather on their
under surfaces before they are screwed down in
their places, unless, indeed, they are glued down
immovably. The places for the screws, as well as
for those which secure the whole upper board to the
table, must be carefully determined with reference
to the grooves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 12 is intended to show, in a rough way,
how in an upper board BB grooves may conduct
the wind from the holes in a slider AA to a row of
pipe-holes near the margin of the board, resulting
in an arrangement like that shown in Fig. 8. The
dotted lines are meant to indicate grooves cut
in the under side of the board. It is clear that
these might be made to cross the others, so that
different plantations of pipes might be obtained, as
in Fig. 9.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 12.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;These figures, however, must be understood
rather as illustrations of our meaning than
as representations of actual work.</p>

<p>Conveyancing tubes are in constant use, not
only as substitutes for grooving, but as ancillary
to it. They are made of pipe-metal, and from
about &#8541; inch in diameter to much larger sizes.
To manage them neatly and well you should be
adroit in the use of the soldering-iron. They are
commonly smeared over with a composition which
will not receive the melted solder; this composition
is scraped off at the points where a junction is
to be made at an angle, and with the usual copper
tool, a little resin and tallow, the solder is applied.
Much practice is needed to give mastery of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
process, apparently so easy; we have known
instances in which it has been avoided altogether
by covering the junctions of the conductors with
white leather secured by thick flour paste. It is
right, also, to add, that we have seen successful
conveyances made of cartridge paper rolled upon
wooden mandrels with paste. Any tin-plate
worker in your town or village would make them
of his own material or of zinc, and in an hour or
two would solder all the junctions for you when
you had planned your arrangement thoroughly.</p>

<p>Assuming, however, the use of the usual tubes,
we may say that they are thus applied. Let
us suppose that the large pipe shown in Fig. 10
is to be conducted off from the sound-board at the
higher level to the plank on which it stands. Bore
the hole in the upper board a trifle larger than the
outside diameter of the tube. Glue a patch of
white leather over the hole, and cut out the aperture
in this leather somewhat smaller than the
hole, leaving an excess of leather all round the
hole of about 1/8 inch. Then, making the end of
the tube a little conical, thrust it into the hole;
it will carry in with it the surplus margin of
the leather, which will form around it an air-tight
joint or collar. A right angle may be allowed
in the tube at this first commencement at the hole
itself, but in its subsequent course sharp corners
should be avoided. The pipe is planted on a hole
bored to a sufficient depth in a plank; a second
hole, suited to a conducting tube, is bored at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
convenient distance from this, and communication
made between these two holes by a groove in the
under side of the plank closed in with leather,
parchment, thick paper, or wood; then the end of
the tube is forced as before into the hole bored for
it and provided with leather packing, and all is
complete.</p>

<p>It is by these means that "speaking fronts" are
arranged according to any design.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;If you have all your pipes, metal as
well as wood, ready at hand, it might be well to
pierce the rack-board and fit them in their places
at this stage of the proceedings, because chips and
dust are inseparable from the operation, and may
be more troublesome and mischievous after the
pallets are put in than now. Those readers who
resolve on this course may turn, then, to the subsequent
pages, in which they will find all the directions
which are necessary for their guidance. For
our own part, we prefer to continue in the next
chapter our account of the mechanism of the sound-board.</p>

<p>We may further remark, that while the boring-tools
are in use we may perhaps do wisely in
piercing holes also for the screws which are to
hold the upper boards down upon the sliders. If
the planing has been perfectly true, about four
pairs of screws should be enough for each upper
board, and no extra screws should be required to
force the boards into closer contact at any intermediate
part. The screws should pass clear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
easily through the holes in the boards, and should
bite well in the table beneath. The heads of the
screws should be let down below the level of the
upper surface of the boards by counter-sinking,
and it is a useful practice to mark the places of
these screws on the rack-board as well, and to
bore corresponding holes in this latter, in order
that if hereafter a slider should be pinched too
tightly between the upper board and table, the
end of a long screw-driver may be introduced to
ease it by slackening the screws without disturbing
the pipes.</p>

<p>But we shall have to return to this part of our
subject.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c"><i>THE WIND-CHEST.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> somewhat wearisome task of boring more than
250 holes in the sound-board being now assumed
as accomplished, we may take the upper boards
and sliders apart, and retouch the holes here and
there, as required, with the hot iron. The apertures
of the holes in the interior of the channels must
be thus attended to, as the boring-bit may have
occasionally torn the wood and left rough edges.
Upon the faintest suspicion arising in your mind
of any flaw or crack set up in any channel during
the business of boring, smear over the whole interior
of that channel anew with thin glue, letting it flow
as before into the angles. A running of the wind
from one channel to the next is, as we have said,
the most provoking of all defects, and might compel
us to pull the whole of the organ to pieces after it
was set up.</p>

<p>The running of wind from one pipe-hole to an
adjacent one, either under the slider or between
the slider and upper board, though very annoying,
is a much less serious evil. As a precaution against
its occurrence, it is usual to make little cuts or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
canals running tortuously all across the table from
edge to edge between the pipe-holes, and to make
similar canals or ducts across the under side of the
upper boards, so that no vagrant wind can pass
from a hole to its neighbour in any direction without
encountering one of these little cuts, and being
conducted by it to the edge of the sound-board,
where it will escape harmlessly. If the planing of
all the surfaces is absolutely perfect, these cuts
should be unnecessary, and we have seen highly
finished sound-boards in which they were omitted;
but we must recommend their introduction by all
young beginners. They may be neatly and quickly
formed by using the <span class="sym">V</span>-shaped tool common among
sculptors in wood, and procurable at any good tool
warehouse. Its two edges should be exceedingly
keen. The cuts may be about &#8539; inch in depth.</p>

<p>After this is done, the movement to and fro of
the sliders should be regulated by cutting a little
slot in each of them, and letting a very stout pin
of wood or iron into the table within the slot, so as
to stop the slider at the exact points. Of course all
your sliders will have the same extent of play, say
1 inch, less or more, according to your arrangement
of the pipe-holes. You will probably have so far
thought over your whole work as to be able also to
cut the openings or slots in the projecting ends of
the sliders by which the mechanism for drawing
them in and out will be applied to them. We shall
show, hereafter, one or two different ways of effecting
this movement to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>After this, take some good blacklead in powder,
and with a stiff brush rub it over every part of the
table until the whole surface has a lustre like that
of a well-cleaned boot. Treat the sliders and the
under side of the upper boards in the same way.
This application of blacklead greatly diminishes
friction between wooden surfaces brought into contact.
Some operators mix the blacklead powder
into a thick paste with spirits of turpentine, or with
water. We prefer using it dry, but we heartily
endorse M. Hamel's complaint that it is difficult to
procure blacklead of good quality. That which is
sold for household purposes is often little better
than a gritty sand.</p>

<p>When the blacklead has been applied, the
bearers may be pinned down in their places with
small brads. The holes which you have bored for
the screws will be conspicuous in them: over each
of these holes, using thin glue or paste, place a
slip of paper, extending 2 or 3 inches along the
bearer on each side of the hole. The use of this is
to hold up the upper board, in order that the slider
may not be pinched so tightly as to be immovable.
The upper boards may then be laid upon the
bearers, with the sliders in place, and the screws
turned until the sliders can be made to glide to and
fro with smooth and easy motion.</p>

<p>Our bench, let us assume, has been swept and
cleaned up after this blacklead rubbing, and now
we turn over our work and proceed to a new class
of operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>We have to attach to this lower side of our
sound-board a shallow box of the same length,
and about 3 inches deep, called the wind-chest,
which is to contain the apparatus by which the
admission of compressed air to the channels is
governed, and which is in direct communication
with the bellows by means of a wooden tube called
the wind-trunk.</p>

<p>We are mindful, of course, in drawing up this
account of organ-building operations, that the
majority of our readers stand in no need of definitions
of these common terms. To such readers it
is superfluous to explain that the valves by which
the channels are kept closed while the keys are
untouched by the fingers are called "pallets," and
that these pallets are slips of wood a few inches in
length, planed to a triangular prism-like section,
faced with soft white leather, and held up against
the channels, so as effectually to prevent the ingress
of air, by springs. When the keys are pressed, the
pallets corresponding to them are drawn down or
opened by wires called "pull-downs," passing in an
air-tight contrivance through the bottom of the chest.</p>

<p>Fig. 13 is a transverse section of the wind-chest,
in which <i>a</i> is the pallet, held up by <i>b</i>, the spring,
and drawn down by <i>c</i>, the wire. Part of the sound-board
is shown above, also in section, as will be
easily comprehended; and Fig. 14 is a view of part
of the interior of the wind-chest when the front
board is removed, four of the grooves being shown
in section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>We proceed by sections, with intervening remarks,
as in Chapter III.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus1">
<img src="images/fig16.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 13.</p>
</div>

<p>1. Seven inches will be an ample length for the
pallets in our organ; and as our channels are about
12&#189; inches in length (inside measurement), there
will be between 5 and 6 inches of the channels
uncovered by the pallets, and closed permanently
in another way.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;We take 7 inches as the length of our
pallets on the assumption that the widths of the
channels are proportioned
to a sound-board
about 4 feet long.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig17.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Between the bars
of the sound-board, at a
distance of 6&#189; inches
from that side at which
you mean the movable
front board to be, glue pieces of thin wood about
2 inches long and fitting nicely, and when the glue
is dry dress these over with a fine plane truly flush
with the edges of the bars and of the cheeks. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
have now a firm wooden surface to which you will
glue, by-and-by, the little flap of leather which
forms the hinge of the pallet.</p>

<p>3. The width of the wind-chest will be governed
by that of the space covered by the pallets to be
enclosed within it, in our case about 8 or 9 inches.
3 inches will be a sufficient depth. Make the two
ends or cheeks of stout stuff, and face them up to
correspond with those of the sound-board, with
which they will be flush, taking care that their
thickness is not so great as to prevent the leaving
of an ample margin to the two extreme channels
for the pallet to rest upon.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;In one of these cheeks a trunk-hole
may have to be cut for the entrance of the wind.
We ourselves greatly prefer making the trunk-hole
in the bottom board of our chests. Your plans
may not admit of this, and you will act accordingly.</p>

<p>The back of the chest, called the "wind-bar," <i>d</i>,
Fig. 13, should be of strong and sound stuff, oak or
mahogany, as it greatly helps to strengthen the
whole sound-board and to bear the weight of the
pipes. The corners should be dovetailed, or otherwise
well and firmly jointed. These three pieces,
the two cheeks and the back or wind-bar, will now
be attached to the sound-board with glue and
screws, to be separated from it no more; but the
bottom, <i>e</i> (of 1-inch pine), will be fixed on with
screws only, strips of soft white leather being interposed
between the surfaces to ensure air-tightness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and the front board, <i>f</i>, will be similarly fitted with
an eye to occasional removal.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;All such screws should be dipped in
melted tallow, or otherwise well greased before
use, that they may not rust in their places.</p>

<p>4. Prepare the pallets from clean and very dry
pine. Every pallet will be at least &#188; inch wider
than its channel, that it may have not less than
&#8539; inch of overlapping or margin on each side, and
it will have more than this space to spare at each
end. The pallets will be separated from each
other when finally put in by stout pins of iron or
brass, driven into the bars <i>g</i>, Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.
Two such pins may be necessary between many of
the pallets if the plan of your sound-board has
given unusual thickness to some of the bars, and
therefore unusual spaces between the pallets.</p>

<p>5. The pallets are to be faced with white sheep-skin,
and it is usual, but not absolutely necessary,
to give two layers of it to each pallet. About an
inch of surplus will be left at one end to form the
hinge; and this hinge should be stiffened by gluing
a slip of thinner leather upon it and upon the
sloped-off end of the pallet. The quality of the
facing leather is of the highest importance, and
we must counsel the reader to procure it from a
builder, or from one of the shops which supply
builders' materials. The price of such skins is
between three and four shillings. If an inferior
leather is used disappointment is sure to ensue;
and though leather of very promising appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
may be bought at the fellmongers' or shoemakers'
in your town, you will only be put to new expense
and additional trouble in the end by using it. In
putting the leather on the pallets, a common plan
is to pin down a sheet of glass-paper of medium
roughness on a board, and to scatter a little
whitening on it. The face of each leathered
pallet (when the glue is dry) is gently drawn
across this whitened surface. If, however, the
leather is of superior quality in the first instance
the glass-paper may be omitted, and a little
whitening rubbed upon the leathered face will
suffice. Even this may not be essential.</p>

<p>6. In working the pallets in take great care that
each channel is covered by its pallet with an equal
margin or surplus on each side of it. It is well to
trace pencil lines on the bars as a guide. As you
glue down each hinge give a little tap with a light
hammer to the pallet, and satisfy yourself by inspection
that the impression on the leather is equal
and similar in every part. Allow no defect to pass.
Rectify, for instance, the slightest bruise or depression
in any of the bars at the points covered
by the pallets. See, also, that all the pallets play
easily between their guide-pins. Finally, a slip of
wood about an inch wide may be bradded down
upon the hinge-pieces. This is not essential, but
it is a protection against possible straining and
injury to the hinge by incautious treatment hereafter
in cleaning the surface of the pallets.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;Organs have been constructed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
which the pallets were made to play upon a pin
at the hinder end, and not upon a leathern hinge
glued to the bars. Such pallets could be taken
out one by one at any time for repair or cleaning.
But repairs and cleaning, if the original workmanship
is good, become necessary only at extremely
rare intervals, and these removable pallets may be
ranked among the mere curiosities of our subject.
They are described and figured, however, by
Seidel.</p>

<p>7. The springs, see Fig. 13, are now commonly
of steel, which has extensively superseded brass, in
consequence of the deterioration to which the latter
metal is subject. We are bound to say, however,
that we have used springs of best brass wire, even
of late years, without any disappointing results,
and that sets of such brass springs are, to our
knowledge, as efficient as ever after thirty or forty
years of constant use. But it is undeniable that
the brass wire now procurable is subject to a
change under the influence of damp and (it is
said) under that of the fumes of gas, which renders
it brittle and quite useless for purposes which
require flexibility. Springs certainly cannot be
made from wire so spoilt; but, as we have said,
when once made from new wire, they may continue
in use for periods practically unlimited.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The store of brass wire should be kept
wrapped up in brown paper. This applies also to
brass plate.</p>

<p>Whatever the wire, the springs may be quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
fashioned by using a board, Fig. 15, in which you
have fixed a stout wooden peg, <i>x</i>, and two pins, <i>y</i>
and <i>z</i>. The wire, if brass,
should be about No. 17 or
No. 18 of the gauge. The formation
of the spring, by twisting
the wire round <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>,
is too obvious to require further remark. The arms
of the spring maybe about 5 inches
in length, and they are curved outwards
(see Fig. 16) by drawing them
between the thumb and fingers.
When so curved, and left uncompressed,
the gape or distance between
the extremities will be 7 or 8 inches.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/fig18.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/fig19.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 16.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The strength of the springs must be
regulated by your plans in other respects. We
ourselves like strong springs, even if the manual
touch be in consequence a little heavy.</p>

<p>8. The two extremities of each spring are bent
at a right angle or nearly. One of these will be
inserted, but quite loosely, in a small hole or
punch-mark near the middle of the back of the
pallet; the other, also quite loosely, in a similar
hole or depression in a wooden bar extending the
whole length of the wind-chest, and screwed down
within two notches made for it in the inside of the
cheeks. As the united pressure of the 54 springs
will certainly bend this bar, it is well to introduce
a long screw at about its middle point, passing
through it, and biting well in one of the sounding-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>bars.
The spring-bar has a slip of wood, cedar
or mahogany, about 2 inches wide, glued or
bradded to it along the
side which is to be nearest
to the back of the chest.
The springs will be held
parallel to their pallets by
playing loosely in cuts,
about &#8539; inch wide, made
in this slip of wood (Fig.
17).</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 17.</p>
</div>

<p>The socket, or punch-mark, upon which the
pressure of the spring is exerted, should be a little
in advance of the middle of the pallet, so that the
latter may be held up against the bars throughout
its extent. The spring, be it carefully observed, is
loosely held in place by the sockets and by the
rack in which it plays, and it can be removed at
any future time by the aid of the little clever tool
which we have figured in Fig. 18, and which you
can make for yourself.</p>



<p>When all this is done, furnish every pallet, if you
have not already done so at an earlier stage, with
a little ring or crook, by which to draw it down.
This ring is best made by bending one end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
bit of suitable wire, and thrusting the other
obliquely into the pallet (see Fig. 18<i>a</i>). This is
better than driving in a little
staple vertically. The rings
may be in a line drawn across
the pallets about 1&#189; inches from their extremities.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig21.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 18.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;But it will be convenient that the
rings to which the pull-downs will be hooked
should be quite clear of the guide-pins.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption center little">Fig. 18<i>a</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>9. The bottom board being now put in its place
for the moment, draw a line upon it from end to
end exactly above the line of rings on the pallets,
and draw lines at right angles to this corresponding
with the centre of each channel, and therefore of
each pallet. At each of these points a pull-down
will pass through the board, and it is plain that it
must be made to do so without allowing the wind
included in the chest to escape. This was formerly
effected by "purses" (French, <i>boursettes</i>), little
leather bags, tied or otherwise attached to the
pull-downs. We have seen this method successfully
tried, but it is now so completely superseded
by a simpler and more effectual plan that we do
not think it worth our while to say more of it.</p>

<p>The arrangement now invariably adopted is thus
made:&mdash;Procure a strip of brass plate, or several
strips, equal in the aggregate to the length of the
chest, and about 1&#189; inch or 2 inches wide. In
too many organs this plate is poor stuff, not
thicker than a visiting-card, sometimes even of
zinc only, but in our opinion it should be at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
as thick as a shilling. Drill holes in this plate
near the edges, and pin it down for the moment on
the bottom board, so that the lines of holes for the
pull-downs may run along its middle. Mark on
the brass the intersections of the lines as before.
Having previously chosen the wire for your pull-downs
(of which more directly), take a fine drill,
with your breast-plate and bow, and on a bit of
waste plate try the size of the hole made by it,
altering it on the oil-stone until the hole receives
the wire with the nicest and most accurate fit.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;It will be well to store away the drill
afterwards, with a bit of the wire as a specimen,
and to use it for no other purpose.</p>

<p>This drilling is not a difficult operation, and only
requires care and delicate manipulation. Of course,
however, any clockmaker would drill the holes for
you. Assuming confidently that you will drill
them yourself, we recommend you to hold the
bottom board, with the plate on it, in the screw-clamp
of your bench, or in a similar vertical position,
so that as the drill penetrates the brass it may
be received by the soft wood of the board. This
will diminish the risk of breaking it.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;Those who have a light handy lathe
will know how to utilise it in drilling the holes in
the brass plate apart from the board.</p>

<p>When all the holes are drilled, remove the plate,
and clean off with a fine file the rough projections
thrown up by the drill. With a much larger drill,
twirled gently between the thumb and finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
smooth the edges of all the holes on both sides of
the plate. Try a bit of the wire in every hole, and
draw it to and fro, when necessary, until its passage
is perfectly smooth and easy. Grease should not
be used; or, if a little tallow is rubbed over the
wire, it should be wiped off clean.</p>

<p>The holes in the bottom board itself may be of
any size we please, since they have nothing to do
with keeping in the wind, and merely allow a perfectly
clear passage for the wire pull-downs.</p>

<p>It is plain that if we now pin down the drilled
plate in its place, the arrangement will not be
complete without some provision for preventing
the escape of wind in large quantities, and with
an intolerable hissing noise, at the edges of the
plate.</p>

<p>The builders prevent this escape and hissing by
fitting two long slips or tringles of wood <a href="#illus1">(see <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>,
Fig. 13)</a> along the two edges of the plate with glue
and brads, or screws. These slips press the plate
closely to the board throughout its entire length,
and they protect from injury at the same time the
rings of the pull-downs, which might easily be bent
and distorted.</p>

<p>Using thicker plate, however, we ourselves
greatly prefer to glue a strip of white leather, of
the same width as the plate, over the holes in the
board, piercing it with a sufficiently large awl at
the centre of each hole, and we screw down our
plate upon this leather, using numerous short
screws, placed only 4 or 5 inches apart, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
through holes drilled near the edges of the plate,
and countersunk in the usual way. All escape of
air is thus most effectually prevented, and the slips
or tringles of wood become unnecessary, except,
indeed, in their secondary character as protectors
of the rings.</p>

<p>The bottom board may now be put on, and
strongly secured by plenty of screws, well lubricated
with tallow. Prepare the pull-downs, of
uniform length, each with its little ring neatly
formed; pass each through its hole in the plate,
and with suitable pliers form the top of the wire
into a hook, which takes hold of the ring of the
pallet.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;Or you may pass all the wires through
the holes, and form the hooks upon their ends
before you fix the board in its place.</p>

<p>The builders often muffle the hook or ring with
silk thread, or a morsel of soft and thin leather, to
prevent a slight clicking noise which might be
heard of wire against wire. This, however, is
really not essential. It is, or formerly was, very
common also to interpose an <span class="sym">S</span> of wire between
the hook of the pull-down and the ring of the
pallet. These connecting links are unnecessary,
and are better omitted.</p>

<p>According to strict rule the pull-downs, passing
through holes in brass, should themselves be of
iron or steel; but we have always used brass
wire, and we must refer our readers to what we
have said of this material in treating of springs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
They must judge for themselves. The essential
thing is that the wires should play easily and
smoothly through the holes, drawing down the
pallets with perfect freedom, and allowing them to
return, when released, with a pleasant smartness.
If a single pull-down fails in these respects remove
it at once. Perhaps it is a little bent or bruised;
possibly the hole in the plate may have been inadvertently
left with a sharp edge, which has cut a
notch in the wire; possibly, also, the pallet-ring
may not be quite in a line with its fellows, and
therefore not quite correctly above the hole in the
plate, throwing the pull-down out of a right line
into an oblique one. Rectify all defects of this kind
at any expenditure of time and patience.</p>

<p>We have left all this time several inches of each
channel open or uncovered, since the wind-chest
closes in only that portion of the channels to which
the pallets are applied. We may now finish our
work by gluing white leather, or parchment, or
even only stout paper, over the open part of the
channels, taking care that it adheres well in every
part.</p>

<p>We may add that it is sometimes, or often, convenient
to place the wind-chest under the back
part of the sound-board, and not under the front;
or to place it midway between the back and front,
or a few inches from either. This is done with an
eye to arrangements connected with the action
or movement, which will be described in detail.
When the wind-chest is so placed care must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
taken to provide for the complete closing of the
front board. A ledge of wood should be glued and
pinned to the bars in such case, to afford a bearing
for the front board and to receive the screws which
secure it; or the edges of the board may be
leathered, and it may be thrust in, with a tight fit,
between the under side of the channels (roofed
with wood at that point for the purpose), the
cheeks, and the bottom board, cut an inch wider
accordingly. Wedges are sometimes used, driven
in behind clasps or hooks of iron, to keep it in its
place. But in truth, when the organ is once well
built and finished, several years may elapse without
a disturbance of the board.</p>

<p class="c"><i>THE BELLOWS, TRUNKS, AND FRAME.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all our minute operations with small drills
and fine wires, calling for a light hand and patient
accuracy, we have to turn to work comparatively
rough and coarse. The business of bellows-making
presents no serious difficulty, and we hope we may
pass rapidly over it. We shall have no reader
who is not already familiar with the form of organ-bellows,
which consist of three main boards,
namely, the middle board, the top board or table,
and the feeder, and of thin plates of wood called
ribs, the whole united together with flexible white
leather forming hinges and gussets.</p>

<p>The shape or form of the bellows will of course
be determined by that of the organ; they may be
long and narrow, or short and wide, like the sound-board.
Their capacity, or area, will depend on the
number and character of the pipes which they have
to supply with wind. A common rule is to assign
two square feet of superficial area for each stop in
the organ; but this would be in excess of the
requirements of such a small organ as that which
we are making. 3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
7 square feet of area, will be ample dimensions in
our case, and will work in conveniently with the
size which we have assumed throughout for the
sound-board, namely, about 4 feet or 4 feet 6 inches
by 15 inches. In arranging your plans in the first
instance, allow room for a drop or play of the
feeder of at least 10 inches, free of all interruption
from the pedal or other contrivance for blowing,
for it is upon the capacity of the feeder that you
must depend for the quantity of air supplied, the
upper part of the bellows being merely a reservoir
in which the compressed air is stored away, and
from which it is distributed to the pipes as it is
wanted. The reservoir may have a rise or play of
about 10 inches or a foot. Get out the three main
boards of deal or any sound stuff, leaving the
middle board some inches longer than the other
two, that its ends may rest upon the frame of the
organ, or upon other supports as you may arrange.
Cut out pieces, also, to form a shallow box, say
4 inches deep, upon the middle board, of the same
size as the top board. This is called a trunk-band,
and is introduced to allow of fixing the wind-trunks
which are to convey the wind to the chest. You
will want also a light frame of three-quarters stuff,
pine recommended, to carry and support the ribs
of the reservoir; the four boards of which it is
made will be of the same width as the ribs themselves,
namely, about 4 or 4&#189; inches. The ribs are
of very thin stuff, say &#188; inch, but they must be quite
sound and free from cracks. You will want six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>teen
ribs (eight pairs) for the reservoir and six for
the feeder; of these last the long ones will be of
triangular form.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig23.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 19.</p>
</div>

<p>Cut plenty of large openings in the feeder board
for the admission of the external air, and in the
middle board for the transfer of that air to the
reservoir. These openings may be rectangular,
say 4 inches by 1&#189;, and there may be fully six of
them in each board. After cutting them, convert
them into gratings by fitting little wooden bars
across them, 1 inch apart, let in flush with the
board, and planed level. Each of these gratings
will be covered with a valve or clack of stout white
leather, two thicknesses glued together, and held
down along one edge by a slip of wood and brads.
These leathern valves should play with perfect
ease, and it is well to thin down the hinge-flap, or
cut it half through with a sharp penknife, that the
valve may fly open at the slightest pressure of the
wind, and may not throttle or retard its passage.
It is a common plan to make these valves without
a hinge, by attaching pieces of tape to the four
corners, and pinning down the ends of the tapes to
the board. The whole valve then rises and falls.
We prefer the hinge. After cutting your ribs to
the proper shapes, in which you can hardly get
wrong, sort them into pairs, and glue a long strip
of stout white sheep-skin along the edges of each
pair. Stout calico or linen may be substituted for
leather on the opposite side, namely, the side
which will present the inner angle, and in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>the ribs will be in close contact when folded
together. A glance at Fig. 19 will show that the
upper ribs of the reservoir are in a position the
reverse of that of the lower ribs. This inversion of
the ribs represents the result of a clever invention
by one Cummins, a clockmaker. Before its introduction,
the air in the reservoir had suffered a
slightly unequal compression as the top board
descended, in consequence of the closing-in on all
sides of the folds of the ribs, which diminished the
space occupied by the air. Cummins's ingenious
modification at once rectified this inequality, since
the upper ribs fold outwards, and allow more room
for the air, precisely in the same proportion as the
lower ribs fold inwards and diminish the space.
An unpractised ear might not, indeed, detect the
slight change in the tone of the pipes caused by
bellows made in the old-fashioned way, but let us
by all means follow Cummins's plan. You will do
well first to join the inner lower edges of the upper
ribs to the inner sides of the middle frame; then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>their other edges to the top board at the proper
distance from its margin; then attach the upper
and outer edges of the lower ribs to the outer edges
of the middle frame; lastly, the lower edges of the
lower ribs to the trunk-band. All this must be
done quickly that the glue may not grow cold; it
will much facilitate a distasteful operation to use a
small sponge with warm water, passed over the
outer or smooth side of the leathern strips as they
are glued on. The main hinge of the feeder will
be best made by passing pieces of hempen rope
through several pairs of holes bored obliquely for
the purpose in the feeder board and middle board,
and wedged in with pegs and glue. Fig. 20 sufficiently
explains this. Two
or three layers of the stoutest
leather will be glued over
the line of junction formed
by this hinge. There is no
reason why the hinge should
not be on one of the long
sides of the feeder, instead
of its narrow end, if your arrangements for the
blowing-handle or pedal render this form of construction
desirable. (You have doubtless well considered
your blowing mechanism.) The ribs of the
feeder being worked in like those of the reservoir,
and all the glue dry, fix the bellows in a fully
distended position by temporary appliances, and
fill up the open corners by gusset-pieces of your
best and most flexible leather. Material will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
economised and neatness consulted by preparing
a paper pattern of the gusset-pieces in advance.
Those of the feeder must be very strong, and it
may be well, but it is not necessary, to put on a
second pair over the first, but not glued to them
in the folding or crumpled part. All must be perfectly
tight and well glued down in every part. A
mere pin-hole will betray itself hereafter by a
disagreeable hissing.</p>

<div class="figlefta">
<img src="images/fig24.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 20.</p>
</div>

<p>We had almost forgotten to say that a valve
4 inches square, or thereabout, must be fitted in
the middle of the top board to prevent over-blowing.
This is generally made of a small board of
wood, planed truly level, and covered with two
thicknesses of the pallet leather, rubbed with
whitening. It opens inwards, and is held closed
by any simple application of a stout spring made
of much thicker wire than the pallet springs.
Fig. 21 suggests one of the very simplest of
arrangements. A string, fastened to the under
side of this safety-valve, and to the middle board
beneath it, may be of such length as to pull the
valve open when the bellows are fully inflated; or
the valve may be pushed open from above by a
wooden arm or catch attached for the purpose to
some part of the frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig25.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 21.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The apertures for the trunks should be cut in
the trunk-band, according to well-digested plans,
before the bellows are put together, that there
may be no sawdust or chips afterwards to get
under the clacks; and it is well to give the whole
interior of the bellows two coats of glue-size before
the ribs are closed in.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig26.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 22.</p>
</div>

<p>The little contrivance <i>a b c d</i>, Fig. 22, is to ensure
the simultaneous rising of the top board and
middle frame when the bellows are in action. It
may be conveniently made of hoop-iron, but oak
or any hard and strong wood will be equally good.
If some such contrivance were not introduced, the
top board and upper ribs would rise first on the
working of the feeder, and the frame and lower
ribs would follow in their turn. This would cause
inequality of pressure, since the top board would
not at once bear up the weight of the frame and
lower ribs. The little jointed apparatus redresses
this by causing the whole of the ribs to obey the
first admission of air. A simpler form of it will
be found in Fig. 22<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>We are building a very small organ, but, desiring
as we do to give as much completeness to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
treatise as circumstances will allow, we here
explain that in larger instruments two feeders are
generally or always introduced, unless, indeed, a
"cuckoo feeder" is used, which practically amounts
to the same thing, being a long board hinged to
the under side of the middle board by a stout
transverse piece in its middle, and provided with
two sets of ribs, each set filling up the space from
the middle hinge to the end of the board. This
feeder supplies wind with the upward as well as
the downward stroke of the bellows-handle, but it
would not be suitable for an organ in which the
blowing is effected by the foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig27.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 22<i>a</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>We may have readers who are so fortunately
circumstanced as to be able to apply water-power
to their bellows. In this case two feeders should
be fitted in order to utilise both strokes of the
ingenious little machine, which consists essentially
of a piston moving water-tight in a cylinder provided
with a valve which admits water alternately
above and below it. This is not the place for
entering on a discussion of the conditions essential
to the due working of the water-pressure engine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
they may be studied in any modern treatise on
hydro-dynamics; it is enough for our present
purpose to say that a cylinder not larger than a
common wine-bottle will give ample power for
such an organ as ours, provided that the pressure
on the piston be not less than 30 lbs. to the square
inch, and that the supply-pipes be of ample size.
Water, it must be remembered, does not expand
like steam when admitted into an empty space, or
rather into a space occupied only by atmospheric
air; hence large pipes, large valves, and large
ports, or valve-openings, must be provided, that
the water-pressure, irresistible when properly
applied, may be thrown at once upon the point
where it is wanted. But this is by the way, and
we will only add that the water machine should be
in a room or cellar below or adjoining that in which
the organ is placed, as a slight noise is inseparable
from its action, and it should act on the feeders by
a wooden or iron rod brought up through the floor.
Still better if the whole apparatus, feeders, reservoir,
and all, can be down-stairs or in a neighbouring
apartment, the trunks only passing through
the wall or floor. In very large modern instruments
the feeders, worked by steam or water, are
commonly made to move horizontally, in a way
which will be understood if we imagine an accordion
or concertina laid upon its side. When the reservoir
is fully inflated it acts upon a valve, which
reduces or cuts off the supply of water or steam.</p>

<p>The trunks are rectangular wooden tubes made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of half-inch pine, and well jointed. In their course
from the trunk-band to the wind-chest right-angled
mitres are permissible, for it is a mistake, though
a common one, to imagine that the wind rushes
in an impetuous stream along the trunks as it does
(for instance) along a conveyancing tube when its
pallet is open. The trunks are simply connecting
links between the reservoir and wind-chest, but
they must be large enough to ensure an equality
of wind-density in both wind-chest and reservoir
under all demands on the part of the player. Our
trunk may be 5 inches by 2, inside measurement;
or it may be 9 or 10 inches wide by only 1; or
we may make it 3 or 4 inches square, as may suit
our plans. The ends of the trunk should not be
glued into the openings cut in the trunk-band and
wind-chest. The ends, reduced by half the thickness
of the wood, and brought to a shoulder, should
be glued into an opening in a small board, an inch
or two larger on all sides than the area of the
trunk. Engineers would call this a "flange."
This flange being leathered, and the aperture of
the trunk cut out, it may be pressed with four or
more screws against the margins of the openings
with which it is in communication, and will thus
be removable at any time if the organ is taken
down or altered. The interior of wind-trunks
should be well coated with thin glue, and the
exterior should be painted. Some builders prefer
to cover the exterior of their trunks with paper,
and to line the ribs of the bellows with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
material, applied with common paste. Trunks
have been made, too, of zinc, and oval in section.</p>

<p>The frame of the organ, whatever its form or
plan, should be very strong and solid, and should
stand firmly in its place on the floor without any
tendency to vibration or unsteadiness. The pieces
of which it is composed should be of good deal,
1&#188; inch thick, and from 3&#189; to 4&#189; inches wide, according
to circumstances, that is to say, according
to the weights which it has to carry. The essential
points are these, namely, that the keys, or manual,
shall rest upon firm supports at the proper height
above the floor; that the sound-board shall be
borne upon bearers at a sufficient height above the
keys to admit the intervening mechanism; that the
bellows shall be carried on cross pieces far enough
removed from the floor to admit of the free play of
the feeder.</p>

<p>You will take into consideration, in designing
your frame, the question whether you will have
pedals, and the still more important question
whether you will have separate pipes for them, and
how they are to be connected with the lower keys.
Room must be provided for all the apparatus
involved in these arrangements, and, as in every
part of our work, so in this, we say that the reader
himself must think over carefully all contingencies,
and make a preliminary drawing to scale for his
own guidance.</p>

<p>Enough if we lay down here the following rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The under side of the key-board must be 25<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
inches from the floor, or from the upper surface of
the pedal-board.</p>

<p>2. The under side of the wind-chest should, if
possible, be at least 15 inches above the key-board.</p>

<p>3. The middle board of the bellows should be
fully 12 inches above the floor, or above any trackers
or other mechanism connected with pedals.</p>

<p>4. The front edge of the key-board should project
about 1 foot in advance of the panels closing
in the lower part of the case.</p>

<p>5. Ample space should be secured for a large
book-board by allowing a still greater distance
between this front edge of the keys and the front
edge of the sound-board above.</p>

<p>These are not quite all the considerations
involved in designing the frame. The draw-stops
and their connection with the sliders must be well
considered, and room left for the requisite apparatus;
and the position of the bellows-handle
should be determined, and the part of the frame
on which its fulcrum or centre will rest.</p>

<p>Fig. 23 gives, perhaps, the simplest form of
frame usually adopted for a small organ. It is
made of four distinct frames, united at the angles
by screws, so that the whole can be easily taken to
pieces. It must be understood that the key-board
is carried upon two cross-bearers, leaving the
under part of the tails of the keys accessible; and
the sound-board in like manner rests upon two
bearers under its extreme ends. If any longitudinal
bar is introduced to assist in sustaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the weight of the sound-board, it must be after
careful consideration of all the arrangements for
the action or movements of the keys. Similarly,
the entrance of the trunk must depend on the
mechanism of the action and of the draw-stops.
It is unnecessary to screw down the sound-board
to the bearers. Its own weight when
loaded with the pipes will keep it down, while a
couple of dowels (short wooden pegs), one in each
bearer, fitting into sockets in the bottom board
of the wind-chest, will prevent it from moving
laterally.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig28.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 23.</p>
</div>

<p>There is another form of frame well suited to
small organs, and which we ourselves greatly
approve. According to this plan, which is sketched
in Fig. 24, the bellows are enclosed in a stout low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
structure rising no higher than the level of the
key-board which rests upon its top. The sound-board
is carried upon cheeks screwed or otherwise
attached to the bottom board of the wind-chest
either at its extreme ends or at points nearer to
its centre, according to your plans for the action
and the draw-stops. Or the cheeks may be united
by a stout transverse piece or girder, the sound-board
being then kept in place by dowels only.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig29.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 24.</p>
</div>

<p>The present writer has further modified this
arrangement by substituting a wide and shallow
trunk for one of the cheeks. This trunk is screwed
by its flange to the bottom board of the wind-chest,
where the wind enters, and it is closed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the bottom, where it rests upon the cross-bearers
of the frame. A lateral aperture is cut in it an
inch or two from this lower end, and a short mitred
trunk connects it with the bellows. All this may
be sufficiently understood by inspection of Fig. 24.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The late eminent builder, Mr. W.
Hill, we believe, exhibited an organ at the London
International Exhibition in 1851 which had hollow
framework, serving as trunks. It is evident that
by making one end of our bellows rest upon a
hollow bearer we might omit the trunk-band
entirely, since this hollow bearer might be directly
connected by a mitred trunk with the hollow
cheek supporting the wind-chest. And by making
one leg of the bellows-frame hollow, and connecting
it at top with a hollow cross-bearer, carrying
the cheek on which rests the wind-chest, it is plain
that we supersede the separate trunk altogether.
Such plans as these may amuse some of our readers.</p>

<p class="caption center little">Fig. 25.</p>
</div>

<p>If the feeder is worked by the foot of the player
such a pedal as that shown in Fig. 25 will be found
convenient. It is made of hard wood&mdash;oak, birch,
ash, or walnut&mdash;with iron or brass hoops and
pivots, and is screwed to the floor of the room,
independently of the organ-frame. The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
roller should be covered or muffled with soft
leather, and you will see that it rolls clear of the
valve-holes in the feeder. By lengthening the
middle piece or shaft we may work with the right
foot, a feeder having its play on the left side; but
in such a case the whole machine will be best
made of iron by a smith. He will coat the pedal
for you with india-rubber where the foot rests
upon it&mdash;a much better plan than roughening it
like a rasp. The pedal, as figured, is intended to
be on the extreme right of the player, and to be
clear of a pedal-board of two octaves.</p>

<p>The reader will see that by reversing the positions
of the arms of the pedal it may be made to suit
any little organ with a manual only. In this case
the muffled roller will traverse the feeder not crosswise,
but lengthwise.</p>

<p>We pointed out in a former page that the position
of a bellows-blower must be considered in
your plans for the finished instrument. If he
stands close to the player on either side of him
the lever will be easily poised upon a strong pin
projecting from the frame. A piece of web or a
leathern strap will be a better connection with the
feeder than any rigid bar of wood or of iron. If
the organ is not placed against a wall the position
of the blower may with equal ease be precisely
reversed. The lever, however, may be arranged
parallel to the back wall by constructing your
bellows in the first instance with a view to this,
the hinge of the feeder being on one of its long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
sides, as we have explained in a former page. Or,
with a feeder hinged as usual at its end, the lever
may still be parallel to the back wall by acting
upon an arm with a roller precisely similar to our
foot-blower.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig31.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 26.</p>
</div>

<p>Another mode of effecting this is shown in
Fig. 26. <i>a b</i> is the handle turning on a strong pin
at <i>a</i>, fixed to the back of the frame. <i>c d</i> is a shaft
which should be of iron, but might be of hard
wood, hooped at the ends, having two arms, <i>e</i> and
<i>f</i>, projecting from it in opposite directions. This
shaft turns on stout iron pivots which enter holes
in stanchions securely fixed to the frame. These
holes will be better for being bushed with brass.
<i>g</i> is a short wooden link connecting the handle
with the arm <i>f</i>; and <i>h</i> is a wooden rod which connects
the arm <i>e</i> with a forked lug screwed to the
feeder. All these connections are by stout turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
pins of iron or brass. It is plain that every downstroke
of the handle <i>a b</i> will bring up the feeder.
All this is a matter of mere mechanical arrangement;
the simpler you can make it, by diminishing
as much as possible the number of pivots or turnings,
the better it will be.</p>

<p>We conclude this chapter, and turn to the next
branch of our subject, with the assumption that
the organ is thus far satisfactorily advanced. When
the new bellows are worked we assume that no
hissing is heard, and no escape of air perceived at
any of the holes when a slider is drawn, or at
any part of the junctions of the trunk. We assume
also that when any pallet is opened by drawing
down the ring of its wire, a strong rush of wind
will immediately follow, and will be as instantly
stopped by releasing the ring, when the pallet will
close with a ready and prompt snap. The sliders,
too, must glide to and fro with perfect smoothness
and ease.</p>

<p>Pass over no serious fault. Remedy all defects
with unwearied patience, even if it involves a
reconstruction of your work.</p>

<p>It is usual to paint the frame and bellows (leaving
the ribs untouched, however) with some dark
priming. A dull red was formerly in vogue;
chocolate, dark brown, or a slaty black have now
found favour in the eyes of builders.</p>

</div>

<p class="c"><i>PLANTATION OF THE PIPES.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> explained in a former page that it is well to
plant all the pipes upon the sound-board before the
pallets are fitted, because dust and chips are inseparable
from the operation, and may be troublesome
and mischievous if introduced into the grooves
and conveyances. Some of our readers, therefore,
having their stock of pipes by them, have perhaps
already perused this chapter and acted upon its
suggestions. It has been reserved, however, for
this place in our work, in accordance with our wish
to meet the case of workmen and young beginners
who are under the necessity of proceeding by
degrees.</p>

<p>Possessing a turning-lathe, and resolving to turn
the wooden pipe-feet yourself, you will doubtless
commence by boring four or more holes in a bit of
thin board with centre-bits of different sizes as a
guide or gauge for the diameters of the pipe-feet.
If you mount this little board at a height of 4&#189; inches
above another board or stand, by pillars or legs, it
will represent a portion of your rack-board, and as
you rapidly throw off the feet in the lathe they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
be as quickly sorted by passing them into these
trial holes. The billet of wood, pine, willow, sycamore,
or any other suitable stuff, should be bored
while still in the rough by a bit revolving in the
lathe. The bore cannot then fail to be central.
It should ultimately be scorched with a hot iron,
unless, indeed, your borer has been so well suited
to the wood as to render unnecessary any further
smoothing. The feet will be slightly conical, the
smaller end tapered off to fit the countersunk hole
on the board, the larger formed into a neck with a
shoulder <a href="#illus2">(see Fig. 1)</a>.</p>

<p>The rack-pins should be of mahogany or oak, with
a shoulder at each end, the necks fitting tightly in
the holes provided for them already. These necks
may be blackleaded, to facilitate removal.</p>

<p>All the holes may now be bored in the rack-board
corresponding to our two wooden stops (Nos. 2
and 4), at the points marked long ago, when the
grooving was finished; the board may be placed
on its rack-pins, and the feet dropped into their
places, adjusted, where necessary, with a half-round
file. The pipes may then receive their feet
one by one, and if your calculations have been
correct and your measurements accurate they
should stand in orderly array. Use the spirit-level,
square, and plumb-line in planting the pipes, to
ensure truly horizontal and perpendicular lines.
The feet should not be actually glued into the blocks
until the last little adjustments have been given.</p>

<p>In planting the metal pipes, holes 2 inches or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
more in diameter will be required in the bass,
while those in the extreme treble will be little
larger than a common quill. Adjustable bits may
be bought, clever contrivances producing beautifully
true circular holes <a href="#c2">(see Chap. II.)</a>. In the
absence of these, we recommend you to use discs
of stiff paper or cardboard, representing the exact
size, as ascertained by callipers, of the conical foot
of the pipe at about 5 inches from its lower
extremity; from these discs the outline of the holes
may be traced on the board, and all the holes, great
and small, may be cut out with a pad-saw, or bored
with common bits, in every case a trifle smaller
than they are ultimately to be. Then, the rack-board
being in place, each pipe may be adjusted in
its position by using a half-round rasp, and similar
or rat-tail files. With these you will easily give a
conical form to the holes in the board.</p>

<p>Great care will be well bestowed in this operation.
If, unfortunately, you cut any hole too large, line it
with a morsel of soft leather. But every true workman
will desire to resort as seldom as possible to
this expedient.</p>

<p>Probably none of the metal pipes will require to
be grooved off. But this you have attended to long
ago. If any of them are grooved off, take care that
the grooves are of ample size, that the wind may
not be throttled.</p>

<p>When all the pipes are planted, whatever the
arrangement which you have adopted, they should
gratify the eye by their perfect symmetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"If they do not look well they will not sound
well," was a good maxim long ago impressed
upon the writer by an ingenious German workman,
to whom he was indebted for much valuable
information.</p>

</div>

<p class="c"><i>THE ACTION.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> important subject will be prefaced by a few
definitions, superfluous, perhaps, for some readers,
necessary for others.</p>

<p><i>Backfall</i>. A lever of any clean wood, &#8540; inch
or less in thickness, 1 inch or 2 inches in
width, and seldom more than 1 or 2 feet in length,
turning upon a wire as its axis or fulcrum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig32.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 27.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Bridge</i>. Backfalls occur in sets, corresponding
to the number of keys in a manual or of pallets in
a wind-chest. They are arranged side by side in
notches formed by taking out the wood between
saw-cuts in a balk of mahogany or oak 2, 3, or
more inches square. This balk is called a bridge.
Fig. 27 shows part of a set of backfalls and their
bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Square.</i> Squares are now usually of metal, but
may be easily made of
wood, and consist of two
arms, 2 or 3 inches long,
united at a right angle to
each other, or cut at once
from a single piece, and
turning on a wire as an
axis passing through a
hole at the intersection of the arms. Like the
backfalls, they may be arranged side by
side in a bridge, but the modern metal
squares are screwed separately in their
places (Fig. 28).</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig33.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 28.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sticker.</i> A slender rod of light wood,
not larger than a common cedar pencil,
and from a few inches to a foot or two in
length (Fig. 29).</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/fig34.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 29.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Tracker.</i> A flat riband of pine, sometimes
several feet in length, about &#8540; inch
in width, and less than &#8539; inch in thickness.
Trackers, however, are now frequently
slender round rods, like the stickers (see Fig.
30).</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig35.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 30.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Tapped Wires.</i> Formerly of brass, afterwards
of tinned iron, and now generally of
phosphor-bronze or some other alloy. These
are pieces of wire about 3&#189; inches in length,
from No. 16 to No. 18 in gauge, and cut with
a screw-thread upon about half their length,
with a ring or hook at the untapped end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Buttons</i>. Round nuts of old and thick leather,
or latterly of a composition into which gutta-percha
enters, pierced at their centre to receive the tapped
part of the wire.</p>

<p><i>Cloths.</i> Little discs of woollen cloth, mostly red,
used as mufflers to prevent the rattling noise of
wood against wood, or metal against metal.</p>

<p><i>Roller.</i> An axis or shaft of light wood (but in
certain cases of iron), turning easily on two wires
as pivots, which enter holes in studs fixed firmly.
The roller has two (or more) arms, 2 or 3 inches
long, projecting from it, generally near its ends.
It is plain that any motion given to the roller by
acting on one of these arms will be transmitted to
the other arm. Rollers are in sets, like backfalls
and squares, and are arranged symmetrically on a
board called a roller-board (Fig. 31).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The nine articles just described are all brought
together in the action of an organ, even of a simple
kind. We shall endeavour in this chapter to
show how they are combined in ordinary circumstances,
involving no peculiar complications.</p>

<p>A simple and rudimentary example of the principle
underlying all systems of organ-action may
be seen in Fig. 32. <i>a b</i> is the key-board, in which
each key (as always in England) is balanced on
a pin-rail near its centre, and has a pin, <i>c</i>, passing
through a little mortice cut in it, while another
pin, <i>d</i>, out of sight, near its fore end, keeps it in
its place, parallel to its fellows. At the tail of
the key, <i>e</i> is a sticker, having a wire thrust into
each of its ends, and projecting about 1 inch; one
of these wires is inserted in a small hole drilled in
the key-tail, and conical beneath, or cut into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
little mortice. A "cloth" is slipped upon the wire
to prevent the end of the sticker from rattling
upon the key-tail. The upper wire of the sticker
slips into a similar hole (a cloth interposed as
before) in the end of <i>f</i>, a backfall working in its
bridge, <i>g</i>. The other end of <i>f</i> is connected at once
to the pull-down of the pallet by a tapped wire and
button. Clearly, if a finger is placed upon the key,
its hinder end will rise and will push up the back
end of the backfall, which will draw down the
pallet; and by simply reversing the position of
the backfalls as shown in the cut, we may pull
down the pallets in the wind-chest when placed
under the back of the sound-board.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig36.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 31.</p>
</div>

<p>If, then, we have fifty-four keys in the manual, a
repetition of this simple apparatus fifty-four times
will be requisite to bring every pallet, with the
pipes controlled by it, under the command of the
player.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig37.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 32.</p>
</div>

<p>But this is taking no account of the fact that the
pipes are not planted in an unbroken chromatic
series from bass to treble. In the arrangement
shown in Fig. 5 (and in its reverse or opposite
plan) it is plain that our simple backfalls would
fail us; while in Fig. 6 some of the bass pipes are
planted to the right of the player, equally out of
reach.</p>

<p>Here we resort, then, to rollers. Fig. 33 shows
a single roller, in which <i>i k</i> is the roller, turning on
pivots in studs, and having arms, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, of wood or
of iron, projecting from it. The sticker from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
key-tail pushes up the arm <i>l</i> when the key is
depressed; the roller turns on its pivots, and the
arm <i>m</i> pushes up the tail of the backfall by another
sticker, the pallet being thus opened as before;
and it is plain that by arranging a set of rollers on
a board, as in Fig. 31, we may act with ease upon
pallets to the right and left which could not be
reached in any other way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig38.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 33.</p>
</div>

<p>The roller-board as here described is placed
above the key-board, with action by stickers; but
it might be as easily placed immediately under the
wind-chest, with action by trackers. In this latter
case, the key-tail will push up the end of the backfall,
the other end of which will draw down a
roller arm by means of a tracker; the other arm
of the roller will be hooked to the pull-down of the
pallet by means of another tracker. If so placed,
room must of course be left for the roller-boards by
fixing the wind-chest at a sufficient height above
the backfalls. Figs. 34 and 35 show, sufficiently
for our purpose, but without any pretension to
exactness of detail, the two positions of the roller-board,
and it is easy to see that by reversing the
backfalls, and in Fig. 35 the roller-board also, we
can act upon a back wind-chest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig39.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 34.</p>
</div>

<p>Probably the reader has already surmised that
the notches in the bridge are by no means neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>sarily
parallel to each other, or, in other words,
that the backfalls themselves are not parallel. The
left-hand pipes, as shown in Fig. 6, are reached by
cutting the notches in the bridge askew, so that
while one end of the backfall is over the key-tail,
the other may be under the pull-down; and as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
applies to the whole set of backfalls, except those
connected with the rollers, the whole of the notches
will be cut at varying angles to the central line or
axis, and the complete set of backfalls, when put
in their places, will present a fan-shaped plan.
Hence it is sometimes called a "fan-frame."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig40.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 35.</p>
</div>

<p>But parallel backfalls occur constantly as transmitters
of motion from the keys to the rollers, and
in other positions which will be noticed. The
plantation of pipes shown in Fig. 5, for instance,
and the reverse of it, which has the larger pipes in
the centre, can only be adopted by having a roller
for every pallet; and in this case the backfalls will
be parallel, whether the action be by stickers or by
trackers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Already, we hope, we have given explanations so
far intelligible that ingenious reader's might have
no difficulty in devising for themselves some one
of the numerous distinct combinations which may
be made of the nine pieces or members which we
began by defining.</p>

<p>Let us take, however, the very common arrangement
of Fig. 6 as that of our organ, and apply to it
the rules already laid down.</p>

<p>1. The keys will be procured, of course, from a
maker, unless the cost&mdash;fifty to sixty shillings&mdash;can
be saved by adapting an old set. We ourselves are
admirers of the old-fashioned claviers with black
naturals and white sharps, or sharps of bone or
ivory with an ebony line down the middle of each.
We possess two specimens of double manuals of
this kind; one of them, taken from an organ by
the elder England, is extremely handsome, with
a mahogany frame almost black from age, purfled
like a highly finished violin. It was presented to
the writer many years ago by the late excellent
builder, Mr. Walker. The other double set, in a
plainer frame, was bought at a sale for the sum of
one shilling and sixpence! The chief objection to
the use of old claviers is that the keys, from long
usage or from original faulty construction, rattle
audibly against their guide-pins. This, however,
may be quite obviated by bushing the little mortices
which receive the guide-pins with fine cloth, as
modern piano keys are bushed, or with thin leather&mdash;for
instance, the kid of old gloves. If the keys are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
handsome, a little patience bestowed in this way
may well reward the operator, who will find the
movement of his old manual when this is done as
silent as he can wish it to be.</p>

<p>2. We shall assume that the front board of the
wind-chest is above the keys, and that the organ is
to stand against the wall. Hence the backfalls
will be turned towards the player, as in Figs. 32
and 34. But all that we shall say will be applicable
to backfalls acting on a back wind-chest.</p>

<p>The keys, whether new or old, will probably be
18 or 19 inches in length from their front edges to
the rear. Their position in the frame should be
such as to allow the front edge to project 10 inches
at least beyond the front line of the wind-chest, in
order to allow room for a book-board; hence our
backfalls will be short. But their shortness will
not be an evil, since the extent of their play or
oscillation is extremely trifling. One-third of an
inch will be a sufficient descent of the pull-down;
the other end of the backfall will traverse a similar
space, and it will easily be seen how small an arc
will be described by any point near the centre.
Backfalls from 4 to 6 inches in length will, therefore,
present no practical inconvenience. At the
same time it must be admitted that with such short
backfalls the obliquity of those to the extreme left
will be somewhat embarrassing, and we shall
recommend the use of rollers for the six pallets to
the left as well as those to the right, especially since,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
as we shall show, the width of the roller-board will
not be materially increased thereby.</p>

<p>The backfalls should be of oak or mahogany, and
the bridge of the same, or other hard wood. If the
bridge is not sufficiently strong and rigid, a disagreeable
and perceptible yielding of the whole
manual will take place when the player presses
down a chord. The backfalls, if parallel, or if only
at a moderate degree of obliquity, will oscillate
upon a single wire extending throughout the whole
range. This wire should be sunk in a score or
channel made with a <span class="sym">V</span>-tool before the notches of the
bridge are cut; and it should be held firmly down
by small cross slips of oak screwed with very fine
screws into the wood of the bridge between every
six or so of the backfalls. This is much better than
the common way of driving in little staples of wire,
which are apt to split the wood, and are not easily
extracted in case of repairs becoming necessary.
The small holes for such screws may be bored conveniently
with a drill, revolving by means of the
Archimedean drill-stock, now sold in all tool-shops
for the use of fret-cutters.</p>

<p>Stickers may be quickly, easily, and neatly made
by a bead plane. Take a piece of three-eighth pine
board of the requisite length and dress it over.
Then, with a three-eighth bead plane, strike a bead
along one edge, reversing the board when cut half
through, and using the plane as before. A slender
wooden rod will be the result, which will only
require a little smoothing with glass-paper. To fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the wires into the ends of the stickers, mark the
centre of the rod with a punch or other suitable
pointed tool, and pierce a hole with a fine drill
revolving in the lathe. The wire may then be
driven down without fear of splitting the sticker
or of entering it obliquely and penetrating the side
of it.</p>

<p>For trackers we prefer round rods, made precisely
as above, but with a &#188;-inch bead. If tapped wires
are to be inserted in the ends of the trackers, it is
well to flatten the inserted end of the wire by
hammering it, that it may not turn round in the
wood when the button is afterwards applied. A
fine saw-cut is made in the end of the tracker, the
flattened part of the tapped wire inserted, and
strong red thread, well waxed, neatly tied round.
The ends thus whipped are sometimes varnished
with a red composition. But this is superfluous.</p>

<p>If flat trackers are unavoidable, they may be cut
from a three-eighth pine board with a gauge, armed
with a cutting-point instead of the usual scoring-pin.
A smoothing plane should be specially prepared
by fixing two slips of wood to its face. These
slips will prevent the plane from cutting anything
thinner than themselves. Then, the plane being
held firmly down upon the bench, an assistant,
walking backwards, draws the tracker beneath the
blade until it is reduced to the same thickness as
the slips, say &#8539; inch. The tapped wires will be
inserted and the ends whipped as before.</p>

<p>The squares shown in Fig. 28 are cut from thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
boards of oak or mahogany. Perhaps it will be
found less troublesome and laborious to make each
square of two distinct arms, halved together and
glued at the angle, or more effectually joined by
tenon and mortice. Metal squares can be bought
ready made, or they may be cut with shears from
brass plate. But we should use wood ourselves.</p>

<p>The rollers will be of pine or deal. They are
cut out and dressed up as square or rectangular
rods of the requisite length, but two of their sides
are afterwards rounded or curved. It follows from
this that when arranged side by side on their
board the curved sides may be nearly in contact.
As our rollers are short, three-quarters stuff will
suffice for them, but rods inch or more square
should be used when rollers have a length exceeding
2 feet or 30 inches.</p>

<p>Iron roller-arms have some great advantages,
and they may be bought at a moderate price per
gross, neatly bushed at the holes to prevent a
rattling of metal against metal. But we ourselves
deliberately prefer arms of wood, involving, as
they do, much greater labour. If these are used,
they should be made of oak or other hard wood,
and let neatly into a little mortice in the flat side
of the roller. After they are glued in, the holes
may be pierced in each end of the roller to receive
the wires or pivots on which it revolves, and which
should be stout and rounded smoothly at the
external extremity. One of the reasons why we
prefer wooden arms is this, viz. that the pivot can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
be driven into or through the arm, which may thus
be at the extreme end of the roller; while if iron
arms are used a margin or surplus must be left at
each end of the roller to allow room for the insertion
of the pivot without interfering with the arm,
the screw of which passes through the axis of the
roller. But it is undeniable that iron arms abridge
labour and save time.</p>

<p>The studs in which the pivots are supported are
also among the fittings which can be obtained
from the shops; but we have always made our own
of oak, turning the peg or shank in the lathe.
These studs must be bushed with cloth. Drill the
hole truly through the stud, using a borer much
larger than the pivot-wire. Cut a strip of red
cloth about &#8540; inch in width. Point one end of it,
and draw it through the hole in the stud. It will
adapt itself to the circular hole, and will take the
form of a cloth pipe lining the hole, and effectually
preventing a rattling noise which would certainly
be heard in its absence.</p>

<p>The planning of a roller-board, so as to economise
space as much as possible, is one of those
operations which call for forethought and ingenuity.
The forms which it may assume are
numerous; we shall indicate by one or two simple
diagrams some of the combinations of the fan-frame
with rollers which occur in ordinary practice.</p>

<p>Fig. 36 shows the usual way of carrying the
touch to the pallets on the right and left in the
common form of sound-board shown in Fig. 6. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
set of backfalls is assumed as <i>in situ</i> under the
wind-chest, parallel to
each other as regards the
six pallets at each extremity,
but fan-framewise
as regards the pallets
from Tenor C to the top.
As the actual key-board
(disregarding its frame) is
about 2 feet 6 inches in
width, while the row of
pull-downs on which it
is to operate extends to
a length of 4 feet or
more, we see that there
will be an overhanging
margin or surplus of the
wind-chest on each side
of some 9 or more inches,
and it is probable that
all the pallets affected by
rollers will be included
in these overhanging portions
of the chest.</p>

<div class="figlefta">
<img src="images/fig41.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 36.</p>
</div>

<p>Take a piece of three-quarters
or five-eighths
board, the full length of
the wind-chest, and wide
enough for your twelve
rollers when placed as we
shall now direct. Dress it up, and give it two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
coats of priming. At its lower edge mark the
exact centres of the key-tails from end to end of
the key-board. At its upper edge mark the precise
centres of the tails of the twelve backfalls on which
the rollers are to act, fixing the board temporarily
so that precision may be secured. Along the two
side margins of the board (which has been squared
up true) mark rows of dots at equal distances, say
1 inch or considerably less, according to the scantling
of your rollers, which may be placed as close
to each other as possible without actual contact
when made to revolve through a small arc on their
pivots. You have now all the <i>data</i> which you
require, and may draw pencil lines showing the
exact place of every stud on the board, the exact
length of every roller, and the exact spots on each
roller at which the arms must be inserted.</p>

<p>Fig. 36, in which <i>x y</i> is the key-board, the rollers
and stickers being represented by lines only, shows
that the longest roller, that of CC sharp, is placed
by itself at the top. This is done in order to enable
us to use a single stud, common to two rollers,
throughout the board until we come to the last,
which will stand alone. If the rollers of CC and of
its sharp were thus placed in a line, running into a
single stud, there would be hardly room enough
for the latter, as the arms would be in immediate
contiguity. By giving the CC sharp roller a place
by itself, we get the following pairs: CC and DD
sharp; DD and FF; EE and G; FF sharp and A;
G-sharp and B natural; A sharp will have its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
two studs. Thus we obtain a distance of fully
1&#190; inch between the centres of the contiguous arms
of these pairs of rollers; and if iron arms are used,
there is room to drive in the pivot without meeting
with the interruption of the screw in the heart of
the wood.</p>

<p>When these measurements have been made, and
lines drawn in pencil or chalk, the holes for the
shanks of the studs may be bored, and the board
cleaned over and perhaps repainted. When the
work is complete, the cleanly planed rollers with
their neat studs on the dark background of the
board should present a pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>Sometimes the roller-board lies horizontally.
It is then usually called a roller-frame. Fig. 37 is
a slight sketch showing how a roller-frame may
be united with squares in certain cases. <i>a b</i> is a
key-board, acting by stickers on a set of squares, <i>c</i>,
arranged in a bridge. <i>d</i> is another set of squares
in a longer bridge under the pull-downs of a chest,
<i>e</i>, let us say that of the second manual in an instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ment
of considerable size, placed at the back of the
case, and possibly some feet from the player. <i>f</i> is
a roller-frame, transmitting the touch by trackers
to the extreme pallets right and left.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig42.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 37.</p>
</div>

<p>If economy of height is no object, however, the
roller-board will be placed between the squares <i>d</i>
and the chest <i>e</i> in the usual vertical position, or it
may be above the keys.</p>

<p>Sometimes space is saved by inserting the roller-arms
on <i>opposite sides</i> of the rollers, cutting apertures
in the board through which one arm of each
pair may protrude. This plan may be regarded as
a compromise between the fan-frame and roller-board,
the latter doing duty as a set of backfalls.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig43.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 38.</p>
</div>

<p>This arrangement is sketched in Fig. 38. The
roller-board, <i>g</i>, is above the key-tails, which act by
stickers on arms
brought through
openings in the
board. The opposite
arms, <i>h h</i>, in
front as usual, act
on the pull-downs
by trackers. We
have adopted this
plan in a very small
organ, and under
the necessity of economising space as much as
possible, with complete success, although every
pallet had its roller, the fan-frame being entirely
absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Rollers are often made of iron, especially in the
case of pedal movements, where space is not
abundant. It will easily be understood that iron
tubes of small calibre, plugged with wood at the
ends to receive the pivots, and having iron arms
screwed into drilled holes, would present no
serious difficulties to the workman, and might be
arranged upon a board little more than half the
size of that required by a set of rollers in wood.</p>

<p>We must not close this chapter without explaining
that the plantations of pipes sketched or
indicated in Figs. 8 and 9 may be contrived without
grooving by an arrangement involving no serious
difficulty or complication.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig44.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 39.</p>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 39, <i>a b c</i> is a sound-board shown in
section, divided internally into two unequal parts
by a longitudinal bar at <i>b</i>. The front part, <i>b c</i>,
nearest to the player, has 42 channels, and carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
all the pipes from Tenor C upwards. The hinder
part has 12 channels only, and supplies the bass
octave. These two separate internal divisions will
have their pallets and springs as usual, and a single
wind-chest may include both sets of pallets, or two
wind-chests may be united by a short trunk, or
separate trunks may be fitted to each, at the discretion
and convenience of the builder. We have
now only to adapt a set of backfalls in a fan-frame
to the front pallets, and a roller-board acting on
twelve parallel backfalls to the pallets of the bass
octave, and we have a very compact and sightly
arrangement of pipes without a single groove,
every pipe standing on its wind. If the back pipes
were these&mdash;Stopped Diapason, Bass, 4-feet tone,
and open Flute, wood, 4 feet; while the front
pipes comprised a Dulciana, Stopped Diapason,
and Principal, or some equivalent&mdash;this little
instrument might be entirely satisfactory in all
respects.</p>

<p>We may add that this arrangement of a double
sound-board and wind-chest has been successfully
applied by the writer to an organ with two manuals.
The sound-board was about 5 feet 3 inches in
length. The front division had 84 channels,
viz. 42 for each of the two manuals from Tenor
C to top F; the hinder division had 24 channels,
viz. 12 for each manual bass octave. There were
practically eight stops, two of them grooved to each
other in the bass. Of this grooving, when there
are two manuals, we shall have something to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in a subsequent page. It is not quite so simple an
affair as the grooving already described.</p>

<p>When the key-board is in its place, the stickers
adjusted, and the keys levelled by attention to the
buttons on the tapped pull-downs, a heavy damper
or "thumping-board" should be laid across the
key-board. In modern organs this is generally a
solid bar of lead, about &#189; inch thick, and about
1&#189; inch in width; it is covered with baize on its
under side, and a guide-pin, moving loosely in a
little vertical groove cut in the key-frame at each
end, keeps it in position. Our damper may be of
oak or mahogany, very straight and true, and
loaded with lead, run when fluid into cavities made
with a large centre-bit. The damper, lying upon
the keys, and supported by them, helps to keep
them level, and by receiving the blow or shock of
each key, as the finger leaves it, it prevents a
tapping noise which might be heard if the rising
keys were stopped only by the board of the key-frame.</p>

<p>The descent or fall of the keys when pressed by
the fingers should not exceed &#8531; inch.</p>

</div>

<p class="c"><i>VOICING AND TUNING.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time has now come when we may bring our
little organ into musical order, and reap some of
the fruits of our toil.</p>

<p>If the processes described in previous chapters
have been steadily carried out, the instrument is
now complete (so far as the manual only is concerned)
with the exception of the draw-stop action,
which we intentionally reserve, and the external
case.</p>

<p>We shall insert here, therefore, a few pages on
voicing, the important and delicate operation by
which the correct speech and distinctive tone of
organ-pipes is imparted to them.</p>

<p>Let us warn the reader at once, and with
emphasis, that the process of voicing metal pipes
is so complex that a complete mastery of its
practical details is by no means uniformly attained,
even after years of steady practice under
skilled guidance. A very sensitive and educated
ear, a delicate sense of touch in the handling of
fine tools, and a thorough familiarity with the
tonal quality, or <i>timbre</i>, of the best examples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the many varieties of pipes&mdash;these gifts are
essential to the successful voicer. Hence we
cannot counsel beginners to attempt the voicing of
metal pipes, unless they are fortunate enough to
find themselves in a position to obtain lessons
from some clever operator willing to give them,
or unless they can gain permission to attend at
some first-class factory, for the express purpose
of watching the pipe-makers and voicers at work.</p>

<p>We shall not be deterred, however, by these
considerations from describing, to the best of our
ability, the business of voicing and regulating an
ordinary metal pipe, pointing out specially, as we
go on, all that may be necessary for the removal
of defects and faults in pipes already voiced by
other hands. But we must acknowledge our own
obligations to the little treatise on voicing and
tuning mentioned in the preface to this work.
Those who obtain and peruse this thoroughly
practical little tract will find all the information
which they can require.</p>

<p>Figs. 40, 41 show the well-known forms of metal
organ-pipes as seen in the Open Diapason, Principal,
&amp;c. Figs. 42, 43 give details. The languid,
Fig. 42, is a little enlarged. It will be seen that
the essential features of wooden pipes have their
counterpart in those of metal&mdash;the language, or
languid, answering to the wooden block, the
conical termination to the wooden pipe-foot,
the cylindrical body to the rectangular wooden
tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig45.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 40. Fig. 41. Fig. 42. Fig. 43.</p>
</div>

<p>We have never made any metal pipes ourselves,
and we doubt if our readers will do well to embark
upon an undertaking requiring special "plant"
and appliances in a separate workshop, and calling
for great dexterity and neatness in a class of
operations familiar only to trained artisans. For
the information, however,
of those who choose to
make the experiment, we
may explain that the
metal sheets from which
the pipes are made are
thus produced:&mdash;
"The ingredients (viz.
tin and lead in various
proportions) are melted
together in a copper and
then cast into sheets, a
process effected by pouring
it in a molten state
into a wooden trough, and
running the trough rapidly
along a bench faced with
<i>tick</i>. The metal escapes from the trough through a
narrow horizontal opening at the back, leaving a
layer of metal behind it as it proceeds; and the
wider the cutting is, of course the thicker will be the
sheet of metal produced. After being cast to an
approximate thickness, the metal is planed down
to the precise thickness required. It is then cut
into portions of the shape necessary to give to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the pipes the required size and form, and is thus
finally worked up."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Hopkins and Rimbault, p. 76.</p></div>

<p>The three parts which compose the pipe are first
separately prepared. The sheet of metal is rolled
round a wooden cylinder or cone, called a mandrel,
and the edges are soldered together. The extreme
neatness of this soldered joint is secured by smearing
the metal with composition, which is scraped
off at that part only which is to retain the solder;
but a steady hand, and long familiarity with the
manipulation of the heated copper tool and with
the properties of soft solder, are absolutely essential
to success.</p>

<p>At the lower part of the body thus soldered, the
mouth is formed by flattening a portion of the
cylinder and by cutting away a horizontal slip of
the metal. The width of the mouth is to be in all
cases a quarter of the circumference of the pipe.
In the case of large pipes the mouth is formed by
cutting away a piece of metal of considerable size,
and replacing it by a sheet called the "leaf," having
the mouth cut on its lower edge.</p>

<p>The foot is formed in a similar manner, and has
a flattened portion corresponding to that of the
body.</p>

<p>The language, or languid, is a circular disc of
much thicker stuff, bevelled off round its periphery,
which is altered into a straight line at that
portion which will lie beneath the mouth when the
pipe is complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The three component parts are thus worked
together.</p>

<p>The languid is placed on the wide opening of the
foot, and the windway formed by leaving a narrow
slit between the straight edge of the languid and
the flattened lip of the foot. The two are then
neatly soldered together. The body is then soldered
to the foot, care being taken to adjust the
mouth exactly opposite to the windway.</p>

<p>The larger pipes have ears, namely, rectangular
pieces of metal soldered on each side of the
mouth.</p>

<p>Thus completed and cleaned over, the pipes are
handed to the voicer.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that we left a wooden
pipe, similarly put together but unvoiced, in an
earlier portion of this book. We have now to
explain that both classes of pipes pass through a
similar or analogous course of treatment at the
hands of the voicer.</p>

<p>With small metal tools, called notchers, of which
he has four or five, he cuts a row of nicks in the
straight edge of the languid, causing it to resemble
somewhat the edge of a saw. These nicks or
notches, coarse or fine, close together or at rarer
intervals, as the case may be, conduct the sheet of
wind from the foot-hole against the upper lip of
the mouth, and influence to a most important
extent the character of the tone.</p>

<div class="figlefta">
<img src="images/fig46.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 44.</p>
</div>

<p>In a similar way, and using a file ground to a
saw-like edge, the operator on a wooden pipe cuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
nicks in the slightly bevelled upper edge of the block,
and continues or prolongs these notches obliquely
across the front of the block, letting
them die away or come to nothing at
their extremity. Fig. 44 shows the
front of a block thus treated.</p>

<p>The art of the voicer, however, is by
no means expended upon this notching
of the languids and blocks. It extends
to the accurate and nice adjustment of
the height of the mouth, the aperture of
the foot-hole, and the width of the windway. All
these will bear strict proportion to the scale or
size of the body of the pipe, and to the weight or
pressure of the wind.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the tone, quality,
or <i>timbre</i> of an organ-pipe, and therefore of a
"stop" or set of organ-pipes, depends upon skilled
attention to at least six distinct considerations,
viz.:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li><i>a</i>. Scale of pipe.</li>
<li><i>b</i>. Height of mouth.</li>
<li><i>c</i>. Diameter of foot-hole.</li>
<li><i>d</i>. Width of windway.</li>
<li><i>e</i>. Character of notching.</li>
<li><i>f</i>. Weight of wind.</li></ul>



<p>It is the thorough mastery of the art of manipulating
pipes, with all these essential points kept
in view, which enables the voicer to produce the
exquisite contrasts of tone heard in good organs
between the tranquil Dulciana and the delicate
Salcional; between the Violin Diapason and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Gamba; between the Keraulophon and the Viola,
as variously constructed; between the fluty-toned
stops, of wood or of metal, to which various names
have been given: and the full chorus or combined
power of a large instrument will be majestic, imposing,
and dignified, or, on the other hand, shrill,
harsh, and unpleasing (quality of materials being
assumed to be similar), in proportion to the skill,
taste, and judgment with which it is finally voiced
and regulated.</p>

<p>We have said enough, perhaps, to justify our
advice that metal pipes be procured in a finished
condition from competent makers.</p>

<p>Our little organ contains two metal stops, viz. a
Dulciana (or a small Open Diapason) from Tenor C
to f in alt, and a Principal of 4 feet throughout.
Each of these, made of good metal, should cost
¬£6 or ¬£7. Cheap pipes mean inferior metal, and
this we cannot recommend in any organ, great or
small. The nearer the approach made to pure tin
the better (other essential points being assumed)
will be the quality of the tone.</p>

<p>In ordering the pipes, the weight or pressure of
wind on which they are to speak must be carefully
specified. This may be easily ascertained by using
a wind-gauge, a little instrument which we sketch
in its simplest form in Fig. 45. It consists of a
glass tube, bent as shown in the figure (this can
be done at any glass-blower's or optician's), and
having its lower end inserted in a wooden pipe-foot.
Planting the gauge on any hole of full size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in any part of the sound-board, we pour a little
water into the bent part or dip of the gauge. On
blowing the bellows steadily, and depressing
the key on the manual corresponding
to the groove on which the gauge is placed,
the water will be depressed in the inner
column, and will rise in the outer. By
adjusting the weights on the bellows we
may make this difference in the levels of
the two columns greater or less as we
please. In our organ we shall have a
"2-inch wind;" that is to say, we shall
load the bellows so that the gauge may
indicate a difference of 2 inches between
the two columns.</p>

<div class="figlefta">
<img src="images/fig47.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 45.</p>
</div>

<p>We may note here that about 7 lbs. per square
foot of surface of top-board will be required to give
this pressure. Pieces of old cast iron about an
inch thick may be procured at any foundry, and
form the most suitable material for weights.</p>

<p>The voicer having worked to a 2-inch wind, it
is probable that when the new metal pipes are
planted in their places they will speak with
charming evenness and truth. If some or any of
them, however, betray some defects, it will be well
not to meddle with them until we have satisfied
ourselves that the fault does not belong to our own
mechanism. If, for instance, one pipe should be
softer or less prompt and clear than the others, let
us be sure that the flow of wind to that pipe is not
interrupted or throttled by a chip in the wind-hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
or (if there is conveyancing) in the channel. This
will be ascertained by planting the pipe for the
moment on some other groove than its own. If the
holes and channels are all clear, and the pallet is
opened freely by the key, the fault must be in the
pipe. This may have suffered some little injury in
the packing case, <i>e.g.</i> the lower lip may have
been nipped too close to the edge of the languid,
thus reducing the width of the windway. This
may be carefully rectified with the flat blade of a
common table-knife, or similar object. Or the
languid itself may have been bent or depressed by
the weight of another pipe, packed within it to save
room in the case. If this is so, the languid must
be carefully pushed back to the level by a stout
wire or rod inserted through the foot-hole. If the
<i>upper</i> lip has been pressed inwards, we must
counsel the utmost care in bringing it back to its
position. The pipe should be sent back to the
maker if the distortion is serious or considerable.
If it is slight we may rectify it by passing a slip of
iron bent into the shape of the letter <span class="sym">L</span> through the
mouth, and thus pulling forward the whole of the
lower par of the "leaf," preserving its regular
slope as before. If the mouth, lips, and languid
are all right, it is possible that by some accident
the size of the foot-hole has been reduced. It may
be cautiously enlarged with a penknife or with a
broach; and if under other circumstances the foot-hole
requires reduction, this maybe done by gently
rapping or hammering the metal round the aperture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
with the flat side of a chisel. The builders have a
heavy brass cone for effecting this reduction called
a "knocking-up cup." Similar brass cones, we may
here add, are used in tuning. They are expensive,
however.</p>

<p>All that we have said of possible defects in metal
pipes applies, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to wooden pipes;
and as we make these ourselves we may deal more
boldly with them.</p>

<p>An unvoiced wooden pipe will generally emit a
chirp or whistle before its note. The nicking of
the block will remove this, but if we overdo this
nicking we shall hear a huskiness or buzzing
equally or more disagreeable. This husky quality
may also be due to a too wide windway; in this
case, remove the cap and rub the inside face of it on
a sheet of glass-paper pinned down upon a board,
or plane off the inside face and file the windway
anew. If the mouth has been cut too high, there
may be nothing for it but to take off the front board
and remake the pipe. If the pipe, in other respects
good, is too loud, plug the foot-hole with neat flat
plugs. If it is too soft, the pipe-foot may have
been imperfectly bored, or may be defective in
some way, or chips may have been left in the throat
of the pipe. Ill-fitting stoppers are a fruitful source
of defects in wooden stopped pipes. Refit them in
every case of doubt, and leave no room for misgivings
as to the soundness of the joints of the pipe
near the top.</p>

<p>We must point out to our readers that strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
sonority, or power must on no account be expected
from wooden pipes. A tone utterly harsh and
intolerable will be the result of over-blowing the
Stopped Diapason or Flute, stops of which the
characteristic quality should only be tranquil sweetness
and softness. The flute of 4-feet tone, especially,
cannot be too delicate, and in its upper
octave great patience will be requisite in the adjustment
of the tiny mouths and windways to
prevent shrillness.</p>

<p>These remarks apply also to our fifth stop, which
we have been content hitherto to call simply
"Fifteenth" 2-feet. The Fifteenth proper is a
metal stop of strong shrill quality, having its value
in large instruments, where it is balanced by other
stops in affinity with it. Such a stop would be
quite unsuitable to our little organ. If we are to
have a 2-feet stop at all, it should be a "Flageolet"
or "Flautina," an echo, in fact, of the 4-feet Flute.
This may be successfully made by diligent operators
in wood, the lower part stopped, the upper
part open. The professional voicers produce the
fluty quality from ordinary metal Fifteenths by
peculiar treatment of the mouth. In foreign organs
such stops are generally or often of conical form,
the narrow aperture at the top. These stops (which
may also be of 4-feet or 8-feet pitch) usually bear
the names "Gems-horn" or "Spitz-flute."</p>

<p>We may dismiss the subject of Tuning with a
very few remarks. The general principles of Temperament&mdash;that
is to say, of the compromise or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
adaptation requisite in the modern scale of an
octave containing twelve semitones&mdash;are not peculiar
to organs, and may be studied in any treatise.
Mr. Hopkins exhausts the subject in a very interesting
chapter of his great work. Our useful little
tract on voicing gives all needful information. A
sensible and practical pamphlet on the same subject
has been published by Mr. Hemstock, organist
of Diss.</p>

<p>You will begin with Regulation, that is, with
equalising the power or strength of the pipes composing
each stop. Bestow every care on this,
especially in the upper ranges of the small wooden
pipes. The pleasing effect of the organ will
greatly depend upon success in this operation.</p>

<p>When satisfied on this point, tune your wooden
pipes to the metal Principal, which has been sent
from the maker's ready tuned and voiced. After
this rough approximation to absolute correctness,
go over the whole organ with great deliberation
and care, following the rules given in the works
which we have cited, or in any one of them. A
second or third tuning may be requisite before a
sensitive ear is quite satisfied.</p>

<p>Cones and cups of boxwood, or made of sheet
copper with brazed seams, may be used in the
absence of the expensive cast-brass articles.</p>

<p class="c"><i>THE DRAW-STOPS.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have provided no means as yet for bringing
the sliders under the control of the player. The
mechanism by which this will be effected must
depend upon our plans for the case and book-board.</p>

<p><i>Method 1.</i>&mdash;As we have only five stops we may
have resolved to arrange the knobs in a horizontal
row above the key-board, and below the edge of
the book. We shall soon see that this arrangement
will result in much convenience and simplicity.</p>

<p>The ends of the sliders project at each end 2 or
3 inches beyond the margin of the sound-board.
To the cheek of the wind-chest, below these projecting
ends, will be screwed a stout balk of oak
or mahogany (say 2&#189; inches square), constituting
a bridge, and having stout levers, after the manner
of backfalls, working in notches. These levers
should be of oak, birch, or other hard wood, at
least &#189; or &#8541; inch in thickness, and not less than
2 inches wide; and the pins on which they
work should be very stout, say &#188; inch in dia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>meter,
and should be held down in their places by
slips of hard wood firmly screwed down to the
bridge. All this is
sufficiently shown
in Fig. 46, and it
will be quite plain
to the comprehension
of every reader
that these levers
(like backfalls)
may be askew to the straight line of the bridge, so
that while their upper ends spread out to reach the
sliders, their lower extremities may be brought
into any position convenient of access.</p>

<div class="figlefta">
<img src="images/fig48.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 46.</p>
</div>

<p>The arms of these levers will of course be of
unequal lengths. About 2 inches, or a trifle more,
will be found a sufficient and agreeable play for
the draw-stops. If the sliders have a play of 1
inch only, it is clear that the lower arm of the
levers must be twice the length of the upper arm.
At any rate the adjustment of the play of the
draw-stops to that of the sliders should be made in
fitting these levers, and not in any other part of
the mechanism. The upper end of the lever,
shaped into a tenon or tongue, will enter a square
aperture in the end of the slider, and the edges of
this aperture should be bevelled, in order that the
lever may bear equally upon it in all positions.
Rub the end of the lever with blacklead, and use
this wherever there is friction of wood against
wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The levers being fitted, three at one end and two
at the other, or all the five at the same end, as may
best suit the position of the wind-trunk, the form
of the frame, and other considerations, it will be
easy to connect them with the draw-stops by means
of squares or bell-cranks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig49.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 47.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 47 shows these squares or bell-cranks arranged
upon a board which is screwed upon the
key-frame. They may be cut out of sheet iron or
may be made of oak, the arms halved together or
joined by tenon and mortice. They should work
upon a strong pin of iron or brass, and a small
block underneath each square lifts it above the
level of the board. A trace, or light rod of pine,
1 inch or &#8542; square, notched at one end to receive
the arm of the crank, and at the other to catch
the end of the lever, is connected with each by
a pin of iron or brass, and blacklead is used as
before.</p>

<p>The draw-stops are generally turned and polished
for a few inches at the end which appears in sight,
and which carries the knob, and it is usual to line
the holes through which this turned and polished
part protrudes with scarlet or other cloth. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
tails of these draw-bars, left square, should work in
guides cut in a vertical piece at the back, or otherwise
arranged to ensure parallel movement. A
short slip of hard wood or of metal connects each
draw-bar with its bell-crank. The action of this
mechanism must not be considered satisfactory
unless each stop operates with ease and exactness,
and without any sense of elasticity or unequal
resistance.</p>

<p>The knobs will be easily fashioned, from a good
pattern, by any turner possessing a light lathe;
nor is it difficult to engrave the names on the ivory
faces. A convenient tool for this latter purpose
may be made by grinding down the end of a small
triangular file. But the engraver's "burin" may
be bought at the tool-shops. The knobs will not
be glued into the ends of the draw-bars until all is
complete, that the engraved titles may be rightly
adjusted at a true level.</p>

<p><i>Method 2.</i>&mdash;If it is preferred to place the draw-stops
to the right and left of the player, as in large
organs, we shall have the bridges and levers as
before. The draw-bars will run through guides at
the back, fixed to some part of the frame, and their
polished ends will be brought through lined holes
in the cheeks of the case, fitted according to taste.
The connection of these horizontal draw-bars with
the vertical levers will be effected by squares or
bell-cranks of a form known as "trundles." We
give a representation of one of these in Fig. 48,
where <i>a</i> is the slider, <i>b</i> the lever acting upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<i>c</i> the trace connecting it with <i>d</i>, an arm of the
trundle <i>e f</i>. This trundle should be of oak, birch,
or other hard wood; it has
pins at each end, which are
received into holes bored in
bearers arranged accordingly,
and not shown in the figure,
or in the frame itself of the
organ. (It is well to char
these holes.) The trundles
are of course placed parallel
to each other in a row, and
the second arm of each
trundle will be inserted at the
level answering to the position
of the draw-bar. In
the cut <i>g h</i> is this second arm and draw-bar.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig50.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 48.</p>
</div>

<p>The trundles are easily made of iron, and with
manifest increase of strength and neatness. We
have used gas-pipe for this purpose, &#189; inch in
external diameter. The arms made from iron slips,
&#189; inch wide and &#188; thick, were brought to a round
pin at one end in the lathe. This round pin passes
through a hole drilled through the trundle (whether
tubular or solid), fitting it tightly, and the projecting
end is spread out with a riveting hammer.
All this may be done cold, but still more effectually
with the aid of a forge. The ends of the trundle
will be received in charred holes in bearers as
before, using tallow as a lubricator; or if tube is
adopted, brass or iron pins may be jammed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the ends of the tube, and trued up in the lathe.
All such iron-work, introduced here or elsewhere
in the organ, may be painted over with the composition
known as "Brunswick black varnish,"
which will prevent rust. The holes in the arms, to
receive the pins of the traces and draw-bars, will be
drilled with ease in the ever-handy lathe, or with a
bow and breast-plate, or by any blacksmith.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/fig51.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 49.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method 3.</i>&mdash;In small organs, with short sound-boards,
the iron trundles may be made to act at
once upon the sliders, without the intervention of
the levers and bridge.
When this is done
the upper arm of the
trundle will be quite
at its top, and will be
sloped or bent upwards
as shown in Fig. 49.
Near its end will be a
short and strong pin, which will enter a little slot
or oblong hole in the slider. The trundle will
revolve in a wooden collar screwed to the cheek of
the wind-chest, and at its base in a hole in a bearer
or in the organ-frame as before. The draw-bar will
act directly upon the lower arm of the trundle, and
the lengths of the two arms must be proportioned
to each other, so as to compensate for the difference
between the play of the slider and that of the
draw-stop.</p>

<p>Cases of peculiar construction may be easily
imagined, in which two sets of trundles may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>come
necessary, communicating with each other
by long traces. In some other cases the trundles
may be horizontally placed, like a roller-frame, and
common squares may act upon the sliders; with
upright traces connecting them with the arms of
the horizontal trundles; while combinations of
these various plans will suggest themselves to the
inventive reader to meet possible exigencies of
position or arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Method 4.</i>&mdash;We may still further explain that
trundles may be discarded by fixing common
squares or bell-cranks upon steps or stages cut on
the edge of a piece of thick plank, screwed to the
organ-frame, the steps or stages corresponding to
the levels of the draw-stops as arranged in the
cheeks or jambs of the organ. The draw-bars will
act directly on these squares, which will transmit
the movement to the levers by traces; but in this
case it is plain that the levers will be of varying
lengths, and must be provided with separate
bridges, in order that the proper relation may be
maintained between the play of the several parts.
This plan has much to recommend it.</p>

<p>We have entered at some length into the subject
of the draw-stop action, because much of the comfort
of the player depends upon its efficiency. The
arrangement to be adopted should be well considered,
and the plans for it matured at an early
stage of the work. All the pins used should fit
accurately, and it is well that means should be
taken to prevent the dropping or working out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
these pins. A very neat way of guarding against
this common accident is to reduce a small portion
of the end of the pin with a file or in the lathe, and
to cut a screw-thread upon this reduced portion; a
leather button will then render failure impossible.
The other end of the pin is usually bent down at
a right angle.</p>

<p>Composition pedals, for drawing and shutting off
the stops in groups by the foot, are not wanted in
so small an organ as ours, and we need not describe
them.</p>

<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c"><i>PEDALS.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have hitherto said nothing of pedals. What
we shall now say will not occupy much of our
remaining space.</p>

<p>We have to fit our little organ with a set of
pedals pulling down the bass keys of the manual,
but commanding no separate pipes of their own.</p>

<p>What is to be their compass? On this we have
to remark that when an organ is intended for the
practising of a student or professional musician, or
for the performance by any player whatever of
genuine organ music, the full compass of thirty
notes, C to f, is quite essential. On this point no
room must be left for misconception. But small
organs, designed for humble and unambitious
players, or for the accompaniment of voices in a
room or in a village church, may be fitted with
pedal-boards shorter by a whole octave than this
complete or full compass. A range of seventeen
notes, C to e, will certainly suffice for the ordinary
practice of the great majority of persons who are
at all likely to sit down to our little organ.</p>

<p>Observe, however, that this curtailed pedal-board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
must be placed in the same position relatively to
the key-board which would be occupied by one of
full range. In other words, it must <i>not</i> be located,
for appearance sake, in the middle of the case, but
must be pushed away to the left of the player,
leaving a blank space on the floor to the right.
If this were overlooked, it is plain that a player
accustomed to the imperfect pedals would be utterly
at fault when introduced to an instrument of higher
character.</p>

<p>An excellent rule on this subject has been laid
down by Mr. Hopkins, whose opinion in such
matters is judicial. It is this:&mdash;To place the central
C of the pedals&mdash;the thirteenth note, commencing
from the left&mdash;directly underneath the middle C of
the manual. If this rule be observed, the foot will
easily find all the notes of the lower octave, whether
the compass be complete or curtailed; and we must
leave to our readers to decide upon the range of their
pedal-board after a due consideration of circumstances.
Seventeen notes (an octave and a third)
must be taken as a minimum; twenty notes (octave
and a half) and twenty-five notes (two octaves) are
alternatives still falling short of the full compass
of thirty notes necessary for the practice of the
preludes and fugues of Bach and other great
masters.</p>

<p>The pedals should be made of oak, and should
be from 18 to 20 inches in length, 1 inch wide or
thick, and at least 1&#189; or 2 inches in depth. The
sharps, or short keys, should be about 5 inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
length, but they are glued or otherwise fastened
upon strips of oak as long as the other pedals.
The front or near end of the sharps should stand
up about 1 inch above the level of the naturals;
from this point they may slope up to 1&#8540; inch. The
long tails or bearers of the sharps must be sunk
about 1 inch below the level of the naturals, in
order that they may not be touched by the foot.
The fore-end of the sharps will be well rounded
off, and the upper edge of all the pedal keys will
be made slightly convex. Lastly, the distance
between the centres of any two adjoining naturals
may be 2&#189; inches precisely. Of course an empty
space or gap will appear between E and F and
between B and C in each octave, as those intervals
have no intervening short key.</p>

<p>We have found the following arrangements convenient
and satisfactory. Make the pedal-frame
of stout oak; the back bar, behind the heels of the
player, a balk 3 inches or more by 2 inches. The
fore end of the frame under the organ-panel is
formed by an upper and a lower bar, between
which strong round pins of oak are placed, making
a rack through which the ends of the pedals protrude
an inch or two. These protruding ends,
where they pass through the rack, are muffled with
cloth to prevent rattling, and each pedal descends
upon a small pad of vulcanised india-rubber, and is
met by a similar pad under the upper bar when it
recovers its position. If this is properly managed
the movement will be quite noiseless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The builders commonly use a spring, screwed at
one end to the under part of each pedal, and pressing
at the other extremity upon a board or bar; or,
on the other hand, the springs are screwed to this
board or bar and press against the under sides of
the pedals. In this case the tail of the pedal key,
out of sight under the back bar of the frame, works
upon a pin passing into a mortice.</p>

<p>We ourselves, however, have long used a spring
which serves both for spring and for hinge. It is a
simple slip of steel, 5&#189; inches long, &#8541; inch wide, and
1&frasl;16 inch thick, having two holes near the one end,
and one hole near the other. This latter is screwed
firmly down to the back bar of the frame, which,
as we have already explained, is a balk 3 inches
by 2. The fore end of the spring is screwed by its
two holes to the under side of the tails of the
natural keys (cut away to receive it), and to the
upper side of the tails of the sharp keys. Or, the
spring may be quite concealed from view by being
let into a saw-cut in the tails of all the pedals. We
have found this plan perfectly effectual, and we
strongly recommend it to our readers. The springs
can be made by any smith for twopence or threepence
each. Their strength or resistance can be
easily regulated by screwing them, not to the plane
surface of the back balk, but within grooves cut
in it, 1/2 inch deep at the back, diminishing to
nothing in front. A few turns of the screw (which
should be well greased with tallow), by lowering
the tail of the spring, will bring on it a strain or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
tension which enables us to adjust with accuracy
the resistance of each pedal to the pressure of
the foot.</p>

<p>The pedal-board should be laid upon the floor so
that the distance between the upper surface of the
pedal natural keys and the upper surface of the
manual natural keys may be 28 inches.</p>

<p>The manual should overhang the pedal-board so
that the front of its sharps may be just over the
front of the pedal-sharps.</p>

<p>The seat of the player, to correspond with these
arrangements, should be 22 inches above the
pedals. The dip, or fall, of the pedals, under the
foot of the player, need not exceed &#8541; inch, or at
most &#190; inch, where they pass through the rack.</p>

<p>The connection between the pedals and keys
will be by backfalls, working in a strong bridge
secured to the frame below the key-board. These
may be parallel, in which case a roller-board will
be requisite, or disposed as a fan-frame. The
hinder end of each backfall has a tapped wire
passing through a hole in it, and carrying a button
on its top, muffled with a disc of cloth or baize.
The lower end of the wire underneath the backfall
is bent into a ring, so as to be easily turned round
by the finger and thumb. These adjustable buttons
push up the tails of the keys when the fore
ends of the backfalls are drawn down by trackers
connecting them with the pedals. The eyes or
rings on the pedals, to which these trackers are
hooked, should be bushed, and great care should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
be taken to secure noiseless action in every
part.</p>

<p>The pedal-board is usually secured to the floor
by a couple of screws passing through the side
cheeks. But it is sometimes convenient, especially
in small rooms, to make it removable at
pleasure. This can be easily done by fitting a set
of false or dwarf pedals, about 6 inches in length,
in a bridge spaced to correspond with the keys of
the pedal-board, and screwed to the floor under
the organ. These false pedals are practically short
backfalls, turning on a wire near their hinder end,
and having the trackers hooked to them an inch or
two from their fore end; and some simple form of
spring should be placed under each. Then we
have only to adjust matters so that the protruding
ends of the organ-pedals may rest upon the fore
ends of these false pedals, either or both of them
being leathered or otherwise muffled at the point
of contact, and it is plain that the pressure of the
foot on any pedal will pull down the manual key
as before. Two iron pins should be fitted to the
pedal frame, going into holes in brass or iron
plates screwed to the floor. These guide-pins will
insure instantaneous fitting of the pedal-board at
any time.</p>

</div>

<p class="c"><i>TWO-MANUAL ORGANS.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> treatise must not close without some reference
to organ work of a more advanced kind than that
which we have taken as the groundwork or medium
of our hints on this subject.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may very naturally wish to
understand the construction of an organ with two
or more manuals and a pedal with separate pipes;
and this implies a description of coupling movements
and of the swell-box and its appliances.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us remark that as the swell-organ
is a modern invention, innumerable examples
of organs with more than one manual and with
numerous stops, but entirely without the swell,
were in existence in England up to a recent period,
and are still to be found in every part of the continent
of Europe. A great number of the most
renowned organs of Germany and of Holland,
organs furnished with four manuals and an
immense aggregate of pipes, are without the swell
to this day.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the question
whether the introduction of the swell, as the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
division of an organ with only two manuals, has
been an unmixed advantage, and whether it has or
has not tended to raise the standard of organ music
and organ-playing in England. But some few
musicians may agree with the present writer that
it is quite possible to sacrifice sound principles of
organ-building to the prevailing worship of the
pretty and fanciful effects of the swell, and may
even go so far as to regret, with him, the supersession
of the old "choir organ," with its sweet tranquil
tone and quiet cheerful brightness. We ourselves
make no secret of our wish that in the design
and erection of organs with only two manuals, the
second manual should act upon a choir organ,
while the swell should be reserved for those instruments
in which a third manual is introduced.
But we are quite aware that these views will be
received with derision by a great majority of
persons, who have become accustomed to the constant
use of the swell and of the pedal Bourdons
which characterizes the playing of many English
organists on modern English organs.</p>

<p>Quite apart, however, from these views, which
must be taken for what they are worth, there are
reasons why any reader, resolving from the first
to construct a small organ with two manuals for
chamber use, will do well to resist the temptation
to introduce the swell. These reasons will become
apparent if we sketch out one or two plans for such
chamber organs, and we should only occupy space
needlessly by stating them in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Resolving, then, to indulge ourselves with two
manuals, but compelled to be economical of space
and of pecuniary outlay, we decide at once to plant
all the pipes, belonging to both manuals alike,
upon a single sound-board, and by the system of
borrowing to avoid the reduplication of large pipes
in the bass octave.</p>

<p>To our original design of five stops on a single
manual, let us suppose that we have added three,
played by a second key-board. We must assume
that the five stops belonging to the first manual (the
lower), will be all throughout, and may be something
like this, viz.: an open Diapason with wood
bass octave; a Clarabella, with stopped bass octave;
a Principal, Flute, and 2-feet stop as before. Then
the second or upper manual should have some such
stops as these: Stopped Diapason, the bass octave
borrowed from that of the Clarabella; Dulciana to
Tenor C; Gems-horn, or some other light 4-feet
stop, the bass octave borrowed from that of the
Flute or Principal.</p>

<p>As the sound-board will have two grooves for
each note throughout its whole extent, namely
108 grooves if the manuals are of the usual compass,
its length might be unwieldy and inconvenient,
ill adapted to the size of ordinary rooms.
We must strongly recommend, therefore, that the
arrangement shown in Fig. 39 <a href="#Page_112">(see p. 112)</a> be
adopted. On the front portion, <i>b c</i>, containing
eighty-four grooves, and carrying eight sliders, all
the stops from Tenor C to top F may be planted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
On the back portion, <i>a b</i>, which will have twenty-four
grooves only, all the bass pipes will be placed,
unless, indeed, we assume that the large open
8-feet pipes are conveyanced off. This back portion
will carry one slider for this open bass, one for
each of the 4-feet and 2-feet stops, and two pairs of
twin sliders, placed close together, for the borrowed
stopped bass and borrowed 4-feet bass.</p>

<p>Our readers may feel confidence in the directions
now given if we say that we are describing
an organ built by ourselves and now in our possession.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The sound-board, admitting of eighty-four
grooves in its front division, is 5 feet 3 inches
long, and its seven sliders (we have no stopped
Flute), with the bearers, occupy a width of
16 inches; but the 4-feet octave of the Open Diapason,
and six pipes of the Dulciana, are brought
into sight as a "speaking front," and therefore fill
no space on the board itself. The back part of the
board, with four sliders (two of them twin), has
also a width of about 16 inches, our large open
wood bass being on a board at a lower level, as
in Fig. 10. Thus the whole board, carrying practically
eight stops (one of our stops is of two ranks,
viz. a Twelfth and Fifteenth) throughout, is 5 feet
3 inches long and 32 inches wide.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This organ is sketched in the frontispiece.</p></div>

<p>We hope we have said quite enough in former
pages of roller boards and backfalls to enable any
intelligent reader to devise for himself the double
action of such an organ. An inspection of Figs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
37, 38, and 39 may suggest ideas to him. An
essential point is that everything should be within
reach if defects should require attention; and access
to the back as well as to the front of such an organ
is indispensable.</p>

<p>A word about the borrowing. It is plainly not
enough to groove the two channels of each note together
in the bass, as in the case of a single manual.
If this were done the wind would fill the <i>whole</i> of
the two channels upon lowering a key in the bass
octave of either manual, and <i>all the stops</i> of which
the sliders happened to be drawn at the time would
speak together. Thus our purpose of borrowing
one particular stop would be defeated. We must
effect it thus: the twin sliders will be closely contiguous,
and will only be separated by short pins
of brass or iron let into the table, to prevent the
friction of actual contact. Thus the two holes
which are to be brought into connection are near
to each other, and the communicating groove will
be short. If this is cut in the upper board itself it
must be neatly executed, and the bottom of the
groove must be level and smooth. Over each of
the two holes within the groove so cut must
be placed a valve, consisting of a small piece
of pallet leather covering the hole completely,
and rising with complete freedom by a hinge
along its edge, like the clacks of the bellows.
Each pair of holes being furnished with these
valves the grooves are roofed in and the pipes
planted, as described in earlier pages of this book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
On lowering one of the keys the wind will affect the
borrowed pipe only, since the little valve will stop
the twin hole and prevent the flow of air through
it into the channel. If the key corresponding to
the same note be pressed down on both manuals,
then both the little valves will be blown open by the
wind; but if all the channels, grooves, and holes
be of ample size, so that there is no throttling of the
wind, the speech of the pipe will be entirely unaltered,
since it will only receive a given <i>quantity</i>
of wind through the perforation in its foot, and this
wind will be of the same <i>weight</i> or <i>pressure</i> as
before.</p>

<p>The borrowing grooves may be cut in the under
surface of a separate board, which will then form
a roof or cover to the several pairs of valves
arranged over the holes on the upper surface of
the sound-board itself. Or this borrowing-board
may be put together with bars, cheeks, and an
upper table like a light sound-board. The essential
point is that all the openings be of ample size,
and that the valves fly open widely at the slightest
breath of wind, and close the holes as promptly
when the wind is withdrawn. If due attention is
given to all this no failure need be anticipated
with the borrowed basses.</p>

<p>We have proposed the lower key-board as
"Manual I.," in accordance with the German usage,
and because that arrangement will facilitate some
of our mechanism, for instance, the pulling down
by the pedals of the bass notes. But lovers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
old English organs, among whom we must reckon
ourselves, may prefer to make Manual I. the upper
manual of the two. A beautiful instrument of this
class, built by the late J. C. Bishop, stands in the
chapel of Jesus College, Cambridge, and was the
gift of an accomplished amateur, whose performances
on it are still remembered.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The same
gentleman was the possessor of a chamber organ
of exquisite tone by Bernhard Schmidt, of such
remarkable composition that it merits description
here. The lower manual, or Choir, had three stops,
an Open Diapason, a Stopped Diapason, and a
Principal, all made of oak, and of extreme delicacy
and beauty. The upper manual, or Great, had
likewise three stops, all metal, namely, Stopped
Flute, Fifteenth, and Mixture of two ranks (19th
and 22nd in the bass, 12th and 17th in the treble).
The Stopped Diapason could also be played upon
this manual by borrowing. A coupler united the
lower to the upper at pleasure, and then the "Full
Organ" was produced upon the upper manual
with an astonishing effect of sprightliness and
brightness. Such an organ as this, with some
changes (its key-boards were very antiquated, and
so high from the ground that the player was
perforce erect), might afford an admirable model
for imitation.</p>

<p>Let us add that if pedal notes of 16-feet tone are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
added to an organ of this class, namely of two
manuals, Great and Choir, only twelve large pipes
will be necessary, even though the compass of the
pedal-board be of thirty notes complete. This
great economy of space and outlay will be secured
thus: 1st, by making the pedals pull down on the
chief manual throughout their whole extent as
before; 2nd, by adapting the twelve deep pipes to
the lower octave of the pedals, and by making
their upper octave and a half pull down upon the
lowest keys of the second manual. A moment's
reflection will show that the 16-feet tone is thus
obtained throughout the whole compass, and no
inconvenience whatever will ensue to the player.</p>

<p>The mode of introducing the large bass pipes,
and of pulling down as above, will be described
before we conclude this work.</p>

<p>Still desiring to erect a <i>chamber</i> organ, and,
therefore, to be chary of space and cost, we must
now show how the swell-box may be included in
our design.</p>

<p>We shall suppose that the organ has been
completed so far as the lower manual is concerned,
with all that pertains to it, according to the rules
which have now been given at length and in
detail. In laying it out we must assume that care
has been taken to give increased size to the
bellows, and to arrange the frame for the reception
of a second sound-board.</p>

<p>We feel it due as well to our readers as to ourselves
to explain that we confine ourselves in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
that follows to a description of work done by ourselves
in our own workshop.</p>

<p>We shall place only three stops in our swell,
which will have a compass of forty-two notes, from
Tenor C to top f. The stops will be a Diapason in
wood, partly stopped, and the rest open; a Flute
of 4-feet tone in wood, open throughout; and a
Gamba of reedy quality, in metal, of 8-feet
pitch, but only descending to Fid. G., 3 feet, the
remaining notes being grooved to No. 1. This
curtailment is greatly to be regretted, but such
imperfections are among the objections to the
swell-box, which would assume dimensions inconsistent
with a <i>chamber</i> organ if an attempt were
made to give full compass to its 8-feet stops.</p>

<p>The sound-board for these three stops will be
only 2 feet 9 inches in length, and 1 foot in width;
but the upper boards must have an ample margin
or surplus in both directions to afford support for
the box which will rest upon them.</p>

<p>This box must be made of thick stuff, say 1&#189; inch
deal; it will therefore be very heavy, and care
must be taken to provide for its weight in planning
the frame. It should be put together with screws,
so that it can easily be taken to pieces for transit,
and it is usual to line the whole of its interior with
sheets of thick brown paper, applied with glue.
It will be very convenient, if access can be had to
the back of the organ, to fit the back of the box
with hinged doors, or to make the back removable
like a shutter; in this case the pipes should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
planted so as to present themselves readily to the
tuner. If access to the back cannot be had, then
a space is inevitable in the middle of the organ
for a passage-board, on which the tuner may
stand, or at least place his foot, while he removes
the front shades in order to reach the pipes
planted accordingly. In the swell-boxes of church
organs the sides of the box are generally fitted as
doors; then, the pipes being planted with the
tallest in the centre, diminishing in height to each
end, half of them can be tuned at one operation.
When the pipes are thus planted, the top of the
box will slope towards each side from a central
ridge, like the roof of a house.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig52.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 50.</p>
</div>

<p>We cannot doubt that many of our readers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
had, or may have, opportunities of examining the
construction of the shutters or shades of a swell-box.
We have sketched it, however, in Fig. 50.
The shades are 6 inches in breadth, and of the
same thickness as the rest of the box, and each
shade turns on pins let into the ends of it at a
distance of 2 inches from its upper edge. These
pins work in notches cut in the cheeks of the box,
so formed that any shade may be easily lifted
out and replaced. The edges of the shades are
bevelled to half a right angle so that they
overlap when closed, and the bevelled surfaces
are faced with leather or cloth to
shut in the sound more effectually.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig53.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 51.</p>
</div>

<p>The mode of opening the shades, and
so producing a <i>crescendo</i>, is shown in Fig.
51. <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> are arms of oak, morticed into
the shades at the level of the pins, viz.
2 inches from the upper line; <i>d e</i> is a long
rod or tringle of wood, connecting all these
arms by pins passing through them and
itself. It is evident that by drawing up
this rod at its top, or by pushing it up
from below, we shall open all the shades
at once, and as they are hung on axes
placed at one-third of their breadth, they
will close by their own weight when released.
The leverage by which this movement is brought
under the control of the player may be safely left
to the inventive powers of the reader. It is usual
to give promptness to the return of the swell-pedal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and therefore to the closing of the shades, by attaching
a strong spiral spring to the pedal, and to
some firm point in the frame.</p>

<p>As the swell-box is at the back of the instrument,
its key-action will have to pass or cross that
of the Great organ. The way in which this will be
effected must depend a little upon circumstances&mdash;for
instance, upon the length of the key-tails in the
two manuals. If the swell manual acts by squares
and trackers, while the Great has backfalls and
stickers, the small trackers, being thin ribands of
wood, can be easily made to pass between the
Great stickers. Or if the swell-keys act on backfalls,
these backfalls may be thinned down behind
the line of key-tails, so as to allow the stickers of
the lower manual to pass between them. This
may be understood from Fig. 52, though that figure
refers to another subject. The worst plan of all is
to make the lower stickers pass through holes or
mortices in the upper key-tails, since this prevents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the removal of the upper key-board without a disturbance
of the whole action.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig54.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 52.</p>
</div>

<p>We believe that these constructive details contain
in themselves the grounds on which we based
our advice to hesitate before including a swell-box
in the design for a small chamber organ. It has
been made apparent that it brings with it a considerable
increase of bulk, weight, and complication,
and that it cannot possess the full compass.
We must add that if the bellows are worked by the
foot, the use of the swell-pedal at the same time is
of course impossible.</p>

<p>The large swells of church organs owe their
grandeur of effect to their reed-stops; the
trumpet, of which the oboe is a soft echo and our
little gamba a faint and humble imitation, the
horn or cornopean, and the double trumpet or
bassoon, a stop of 16-feet pitch. All reed-stops
are quite beyond the range of amateur construction,
and each of the above will cost about ¬£25 if
purchased from a good maker and made of first-class
material. Beautiful as such stops are when
made and voiced by highly-skilled workmen, they
may easily be unpleasing and even offensive.</p>

<p>Let us add that the twelve notes of the swell
manual, below Tenor C, may be made to act on
the lower manual by a "choir coupler" (see next
section, and Fig. 52); or, if there is a complete
pedal Sub-bass or Bourdon of twenty-five or more
notes, the silent keys of the swell manual may
borrow the pedal notes from CC, 8-feet tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
upwards. An easy mechanical movement of
squares and trackers will effect this.</p>

<p>Two manuals imply couplers, though we greatly
regret the incessant use of these contrivances by
modern organists.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig55.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 53.</p>
</div>

<p>We shall treat, very briefly, of couplers under
three heads, viz. the coupling of&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>(<i>a</i>) Upper Manual to Lower Manual.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Lower Manual to Upper Manual.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Manuals to Pedals.</li></ul>



<p>(<i>a</i>) The common Tumbler coupler is represented
in Fig. 53. <i>a</i> is a slender bridge, having as many
notches as keys in the manual, and fitted with
short stickers called tumblers. These tumblers, or
stickers, are generally rectangular in section, and
they must fit the notches neatly but with freedom
of motion; the notches are closed in by a
tringle of wood glued over them, thus forming a
series of mortices; and each sticker has a little pin,
or a pair of pins, to prevent it from falling out of
its notch or mortice. Or, the tumblers may be
made from round rods, and may pass through
round holes in the bridge. They are well black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>leaded
in either case. Now if this bridge, with its
tumblers, is placed between the manuals near
their hinder extremities, if the length of the
tumblers is equal to the interval between the upper
and lower key-tails, it is evident that on pressing
down a key of the lower manual the tumbler will
push up the tail of the corresponding key on the
upper manual, and so on throughout the full compass
of both. To reverse this, and to leave the
manuals separate and independent as before, the
bridge is made to take a quarter of a revolution in
sockets fitted to carry its ends, which are rounded
or turned in the lathe; the tumblers, by this
partial revolution, are then no longer perpendicular,
but parallel to the key-tails, as shown by the
dotted lines in the figure, and cease to be touched
by them. On the whole, this is the simplest form
of swell-coupler.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig56.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 54.</p>
</div>

<p>The tumblers may also be placed on or off by
causing the bridge to slide between guides for a
distance of 1 inch or 2 inches. When the bridge
is pushed back by drawing a stop-handle (which
acts upon a horizontal trundle with arms and traces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to give the sliding motion), the tumblers act on the
key-tails; when it is drawn forward by thrusting
in the stop, they fall into a hollow cut in the key-tails,
and are too short to be of use. The hollow
in the key-tails is bevelled, and the inclined plane
so formed is leathered and blackleaded (see
Fig. 54).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig57.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 55.</p>
</div>

<p>The ram coupler, Fig. 55, acts in a way closely
resembling the last. Instead of tumblers, the
bridge carries a set of short backfalls, turning on a
wire as usual, and cut at the free end into a circular
form. The sliding of the bridge brings these
circular ends into contact with the key-tails of both
manuals, or places them in a hollow cut in the
keys, bevelled, leathered, and blackleaded as
before. The ram-coupler can be used between
manuals arranged too closely to admit of tumblers.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It will facilitate our description of the choir-coupler
and pedal-couplers if we here point out
that if a bridge with backfalls (or squares) be made
to rise or fall &#189; inch or more at pleasure, the action
connected with it will be thrown into or out of
gear at the will of the player. If, in Fig. 32, for
instance, the bridge <i>g</i> be made to rise &#189; inch by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
drawing a stop-handle, the stickers <i>e</i> will then be
too short by &#189; inch, or the pull-downs <i>h</i> will be too
long in an equal degree, and the manual will be
silenced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig58.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption center little">Fig. 56.</p>
</div>

<p>An easy way of making such a bridge rise and
fall is shown in Fig. 56. The bridge <i>a</i>, which
cannot be too solid and heavy, is held between
guides, <i>c d</i>, which are blackleaded and accurately
adjusted. At each end of the bridge is fitted a
little roller or wheel of box-wood, turning freely on
a pin. To the frame below is fitted another such
roller, or two, as in the figure. Between these two
or three rollers, at each end of the bridge, an
inclined plane of wood, <i>e</i>, is made to traverse by
means of a horizontal trundle and arms. It will be
seen at a glance that when the inclined plane is
pushed between the rollers by drawing or thrusting
in a stop-handle, it lifts the bridge between the
guides and dislocates the action; when it is withdrawn,
the bridge resumes its place by its own
weight, and the action is again in order.</p>

<p>It is now easy to understand the construction of
the remaining couplers. The choir-coupler (Fig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
52, p. 152), has two bridges, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, with two sets of
short backfalls and communicating stickers. If the
bridges are fixed, then on depressing any key on
the upper manual its tail raises the backfall, which
presses down the lower backfall, which in its turn
pushes up the tail of the lower key and causes the
note to be heard. If the upper bridge be made to
rise or the lower to fall &#189; inch, then the keys are
at once disconnected.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The coupling of manuals to pedals is generally
effected by rising and falling bridges, carrying
backfalls which push up the tails of the keys.
These bridges are arranged one above the other
beneath the keyboards in large organs with three
or four manuals, each bridge bringing its own
manual into connection with the pedals by the
movement already described. One roller-board
(the rollers are often of iron for the sake of compactness)
suffices for all the sets of backfalls, and
the stickers (in this case generally flat strips of
wood) pass through mortices cut in the tails of
the lower keys to act upon the tails of the keys to
which they belong.</p>

<p>The reader will easily perceive from these hints
how the pedals may be made to act through their
whole extent upon one of our manuals, and through
only a part of their extent upon the other manual,
as we have hinted at page 148. There will be two
bridges, one over the other, and a very little
ingenuity will be required to plan the roller-board
so that the central C of the pedals shall pull down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the lowest C of the second manual (be it upper
or lower), and thus give the octave below (or 16-feet
pitch) without additional pipes from that note
upwards. But this, perhaps, belongs to the subject
of the pedal organ, which we reserve for the conclusion
of this book.</p>

<p>It is right to add here that in old-fashioned
organs, both in England and on the Continent
(where many such instruments remain unaltered),
the manuals were made to couple by being drawn
out or pushed in about &#189; inch. A spur or protuberance
of wood was glued to the upper part
of the tail of each key, and a similar spur to the
under part of the tail of the key in the manual
above. These spurs had rounded ends covered
with leather. On shifting one of the key-boards
backwards or forwards the spurs met each other,
and the coupling was effected. Or the spurs were
glued under the front of each key, immediately
behind the beading of the key-frame, and upon
the upper surface of each key in the manual
beneath it, and a similar shifting brought about
a like result. We see no objection to this very
simple old-fashioned arrangement strong enough
to induce us to discard it from consideration.</p>

<p>The common type of small church organ with
Great and Swell (throughout) would be vastly
improved by the introduction of a manual between
the other two, having no stops of its own, but
coupled to both by such spurs. Instead of two
qualities of sound, namely Swell alone and Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and Swell combined (the incessant use of the
coupler being the inveterate habit of most players),
we should have three: Great alone, Swell alone,
and combination of Great and Swell. This obvious
improvement could be introduced into new organs
or added to existing instruments at a very small
cost. There should be a coupler to connect this
Combination Manual with the pedals.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that the addition of a pedal
organ with a Sub-bass or Bourdon of 16-feet tone
is a very important and valuable improvement
to any organ, large or small. It gives a dignified
cathedral-like solemnity and grandeur which every
ear can appreciate. We shall bring our treatise
to a close by a few remarks upon it.</p>

<p>1. The pipes will be made precisely like those of
the Stopped Diapason, of which they may be
regarded as a continuation, and they should be of
stout material, the last four or five of inch stuff,
then three-quarters to the twelfth or thirteenth
note above.</p>

<p>On the question of scale the most diverse
opinions have found favour of late years. A
writer whose <i>dicta</i> are entitled to respect<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> urges
that the lowest pipe (CCC, 16-feet tone) should
have the enormous if not preposterous scale of 11&#189;
by 13 inches inside measurement, and that the
next six pipes above it should be in proportion.
After that, he says, a smaller scale may suffice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
It is clear that if this ruling be correct we may
dismiss the idea of introducing a Sub-bass into our
chamber organ. Mr. Hopkins, on the other hand,
prints two scales for 16-feet toned Bourdons, the
larger of which gives 6&#8539; inches by 4&#8541; as the inside
measurement of the CCC pipe; while the smaller
gives 5 inches by 3&#8540; for the same pipe. We may
safely adopt this larger scale of Mr. Hopkins; and
we will only say further that with our light 2-inch
wind the mouths should be cut up one-third of the
width, or rather less, and the foot-holes should be
of ample size.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Rev. F. G. Hayne, Mus. Doc., "Hints on the Purchase of an
Organ." Novello, 1867.</p></div>

<p>2. Their location in the organ must depend very
much on special circumstances. When they can
be placed in a row at the back of the instrument,
their connection with the pedals becomes very
simple, two sets of squares with trackers running
under the bellows being all that will be necessary.
If the room has abundance of height, the back set
of squares may act on a roller-board, and then the
pipes can be disposed symmetrically, the largest
at each end.</p>

<p>3. The board on which they stand will not
require a slider. It will be, in fact, a wind-chest
only, a long box of stout pine or deal, having holes
in its top countersunk to receive the pipe-feet.
Under each hole is placed a pallet or valve, held
up by a strong spring, and having a pull-down
wire passed through a brass plate in the usual way.</p>

<p>The aperture of the wind-trunk is in the lower
board of this chest, and over it, before the board is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
in place, is fitted a valve, faced with leather, and
made to slide to and fro between guides. An iron
spindle, turned to fit accurately in a brass collar,
carries an arm jointed to the valve by a connecting
rod or trace; and outside the chest it carries
another arm, at right angles to this, jointed to the
draw-stop handle or its trace. We have, in fact, a
trundle passing air-tight through a collar, and by
this simple contrivance we can shut off the wind
at pleasure from the chest. Other methods of
effecting this are in use, and may easily be
devised. The pipes are very frequently placed on
both sides of the organ, to the right and left. In
this case the two chests will be at right angles
to the manual chest or chests, and the action will
be less direct. But it will be readily arranged as
follows:&mdash;The pedal roller board will be long
enough to act upon sets of squares, carried on the
organ-frame to the right and left of the player, and
at any convenient height. The other arms of
these squares act by trackers on roller-frames
placed under the chests.</p>

<p>There are cases in which this roller-board will
be better placed at the back of the organ, the connection
between it and the pedals being by squares
and trackers; and there are also cases in which
a large roller-frame lying upon the ground under
the bellows may be made to answer every purpose.
Bell-cranks, or horizontal squares, may also transmit
the pressure of the foot on the pedal by other
squares and trackers to the pedal pallets in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
manner analogous to that of the draw-stop action,
Fig. 49. There is abundant room for ingenuity
and contrivance in all these details; the essential
points are strength, quietness, and accessibility
for repair or adjustment.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may be able to indulge in
the luxury of a second pedal stop. This should be
a Violoncello in metal, of 8-feet tone and length.
In this case the pedal chest or chests will be regular
sound-boards, with sliders; or the Sub-bass may be
on a chest as already described, while the Violoncello
may be on another, with two actions.</p>

<p>We have only to add, that the power and effectiveness
of small organs may be increased by the
contrivance called a "Terzo Mano" (Third Hand),
or octave coupler. Let us suppose that an ordinary
action has been fitted with backfalls in the usual
positions. Then a second bridge, rising and falling
by a draw-stop, is introduced, carrying skew backfalls
which act on the pull-downs an octave higher
than the first set. Thus the key CC will take down
the Tenor C note, and so on throughout the scale.
It is evident that the effect on the ear will be nearly,
though not quite, the same as if each 8-feet stop
had its corresponding 4-feet stop drawn with it.
An Open Diapason will sound like an Open Diapason
and Principal; a Stopped Diapason, like a
Stopped Diapason and Stopped Flute, &amp;c. To
render the illusion complete, the pipes should be
carried up twelve notes higher than the apparent
compass of the key-board, that is to say, if the key-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>board
has fifty-four notes the sound-board should
have sixty-six grooves.</p>

<p>In a similar way the pedal Sub-bass may be made
to play in octaves, producing the effect of a Sub-bass,
16-feet tone, with a Flute-bass of 8-feet tone
added to it.</p>

<p>Of all such mechanical devices it must be said,
finally, that neatness, accuracy, and noiseless precision
of action are the conditions necessary to
complete success.</p>

<p class="c"><i>VILLAGE CHURCH ORGANS.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> labours have hitherto been exclusively directed
towards the production, in private workshops and
by young workmen, of small organs adapted for
domestic use. That such organs should be of
varied character, and that they should represent
the differing musical tastes and unequal mechanical
ingenuity and adroitness of their unprofessional or
self-taught constructors, is the legitimate outcome
of the circumstances assumed.</p>

<p>The case of organs for churches must be regarded
from a different stand-point. Designed for
public use, and consecrated to lofty purposes, they
should reflect no private fancies or peculiar tastes;
should admit of no experiments or eccentricities;
should be distinguished by excellence of material,
finished perfection of workmanship, and solid stability
of structure. We cannot, therefore, recommend
the construction of any church-organ in a
private workshop. The aim and object of this
volume would be entirely misconceived by any
reader who should imagine that we encourage
such an ambitious attempt. However humble as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to style of architecture the church may be, however
unpretending the scheme for the organ may
be, we must strenuously advocate the placing the
order for its erection in the hands of a well-established
firm of professional builders.</p>

<p>Guarding ourselves thus, we trust, against all
possibility of misconception, we shall endeavour in
the following pages to offer some suggestions on
the subject of village organs, which may tend to
smooth away perplexities from the path of those
who, without any previous acquaintance with such
matters, find themselves called upon to exercise
discretion, and pronounce decisive judgment on
estimates and specifications submitted to them by
builders and by musicians.</p>

<p>In using the term "Village," we refer less to
locality than to condition. We desire to be of
service to the promoters of the erection of an organ
in those very numerous cases in which no skilled
player is resident in the place, and in which the
new instrument will inevitably be left to the modest
efforts of a schoolmistress or of a young beginner,
on whose ability, moreover, no greater demand
will be made than that which is involved in the
accompaniment of simple chanting and psalmody.
It is to the dwellers in such quiet corners of
the country that we would offer a few rules or
maxims, based, we hope, on principles, the soundness
of which will commend itself to their good
sense.</p>

<p>Let us bring together, in a compressed form, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
few of these maxims, afterwards examining them
in detail.</p>

<p>A village organ should be of simple construction,
containing no mechanism liable to sudden derangement.
It should stand well in tune, without
attention, even though placed in a building exposed
to alternations of temperature and perhaps not free
from dampness. Its musical effects should be
readily and obviously producible by any person
sitting down to it for the first time, and guided
only by experience gained at the harmonium or
pianoforte. It should present no facilities for
ambitious attempts at executive display by thoughtless
aspirants. Its power, or volume, should be
sufficient to assert itself unmistakably in a full
congregational chorus; and its tone, or quality,
should be that which long experience has shown to
be impressive and pleasing to the vast majority of
listeners. Hence, it will be capable of emitting no
sounds which might be described by any uneducated
hearer as odd or curious. Lastly, let us add
that its case should be shapely, even if destitute of
ornamentation.</p>

<p>Whole pages of disquisition may be saved if we
proceed at once to apply these maxims to the
specification of the smallest and least costly organ
which we shall recommend for a village church:
an organ, namely, with four stops only.</p>

<p>1. Organ No. 1. The manual will be from CC to
E in alt, 53 notes.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The key-board is more sightly when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
its two extremities are rendered similar by this
omission of the top F. But the further omission of
the four upper notes would still leave a compass of
49 notes, amply sufficient for the accompaniment of
voices.</p>

<p>2. Its stops will be these:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Open Diapason, metal throughout, or of metal
from Gamut G, with seven pipes of open wood
below.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;These open wood pipes, when properly
scaled and voiced, have some advantages over
metal for our present purpose, and may be placed
so as to close in the back of the case instead of
panelling.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Principal of metal throughout, being the octave
of the Open Diapason, to which it will therefore
be made to conform as regards scale and voicing.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The two stops, (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), when played
together, will furnish the element of power, or loudness,
to the organ.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Stopped Diapason of wood throughout, or of
metal with chimneys from middle C to top; but not
with a Clarabella of open wood as its upper part.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The metal Stopped Diapasons which
have come down to us from the days of Harris, and
other old builders, are often of exquisite beauty of
tone. Modern builders are apt to neglect the stop,
and to treat it as a mere "Coppel," or vehicle for
exhibiting the qualities of imitative stops. We
should be glad to persuade them to make the upper
octaves of oak, after the example of Schmidt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Stopped Flute of wood throughout, or of metal
with chimneys as to its three upper octaves. This
stop pretends to no imitation whatever of the well-known
musical instrument, the Flute, but is simply
the octave of the Stopped Diapason, of which it
should follow the scale and voicing.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;The two stops, (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>), when played
together, supply to the organ the important element
of softness and tranquil clearness; and when added
to (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), they enhance the fullness and volume
of those stops, while correcting a certain crudeness
or tendency towards harshness. The Stopped Flute
fulfils a further most important office. When added
to the two Diapasons (without the Principal), it
imparts not only a most pleasing silvery sweetness
to the tone, but gives a definiteness of pitch which
will correct the tendency of school-children to sing
out of tune. This stop should, therefore, on no
account be omitted, or cancelled in favour of more
showy or conspicuous qualities of tone.</p>

<p>3. Be it carefully observed that the stops (<i>a</i>) and
(<i>b</i>) can be made to produce sounds of several gradations
of loudness according to the scale of the
pipes, the pressure or weight of the wind, and the
character of the voicing. Their tone will be further
affected by the substance and quality of the pipe-metal.
Let us confidently assume that the order
for the new organ will be given to no builder who
does not hold his art in such esteem as to be incapable
of using inferior and perishable materials.
The metal should be tin and lead only, in at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
equal proportions; still better if the tin be three-fourths,
four-fifths, or seven-eighths of the whole
alloy. The wind-pressure should be light, as we
desire that the feeder should be easily worked by
the foot of the player. The scaling and voicing
must be left to the judgment of a trustworthy
builder, as they will vary with the capacity of the
church and the requirements of the singing.
Enough if we advise that, even in the case
of the smallest church, the two metal stops be
of bold, out-speaking character, asserting themselves
distinctly, and having no tinge of the
muffled or subdued quality proper to chamber-organs.</p>

<p>4. The case of the organ, even if carving be entirely
absent, may be of graceful and pleasing outline
by making the upper part, above the level of
the keys, overhang the lower part, or base, which
encloses the bellows.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This lower part need not
be much wider than the key-board itself, and about
three feet in depth, from front to back. If the upper
part be five feet in width, it will overhang the base
one foot or a little less on each side, obtaining
apparent support from a pair of brackets. The total
height, if the open bass pipes be set down at the
back, will not exceed nine feet; but the speaking
front may be well thrown up by the usual expedients
if the church be lofty. We strongly advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
that these speaking front pipes be left of their
natural silver colour, which they will not lose if
tin predominates largely over lead in the alloy.
For our own part, we are no admirers of the chocolates,
dark blues, and sage greens smeared upon
front pipes by way of decorating them. Too often,
we fear, such diapers are a cloak for very inferior
metal, which would soon betray the presence of
antimony and other deleterious ingredients by
turning black if left unpainted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> See the frontispiece of this book. Some charming but elaborate
designs will be found in the Rev. F. H. Sutton's "Church Organs,"
published by Rivingtons. Folio. 1872.</p></div>

<p>The draw-stops will be most conveniently
handled if arranged above the keys, under the ledge
of the book-board, as in the harmonium. It will
be well to place the Stopped Diapason and Flute
on the left, and the Open Diapason and Principal
(which will be more frequently drawn and shut off)
on the right, leaving an interval of a foot or so
between the two pairs.</p>

<p>The cost of this four-stop organ, made of first-class
materials, in a case of stained deal or pitch-pine,
should not exceed ¬£80. A provincial builder,
who works with his own hands, might undertake
it for a smaller sum, but we cannot counsel a
diminution of cost by a lowering of the standard
of the pipe-metal or by a resort to inferior
woods.</p>

<p>A hasty <i>r√©sum√©</i> of our design will show a close
correspondence with our initial maxims.</p>

<p>The organ is:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Of simple construction, containing no mechanism
liable to sudden derangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It will stand well in tune, without attention,
even for years, especially if the smaller stopped
pipes be of metal with chimneys.</p>

<p>3. A new player will be met by no special
difficulty whatever.</p>

<p>4. As there is no "swell," there can be no exhibition,
on the part of the player, of the peculiar forms
of bad taste to which that invention lends fatal
facility; and as there are no pedals, there will be
no lumbering and blundering attempts to play
grand compositions never meant for village
churches.</p>

<p>5. Its power, or volume, will be ample for the
accompaniment of the ordinary congregational
singing of two or three hundred persons, and more
than abundantly sufficient for the support of a
rustic choir; and it emits no sounds which can
provoke criticism by singularity of intonation, and
which have not been found, by long years of experience,
to be invariably agreeable to all musical
ears.</p>

<p>Organ No. 2. To the four-stop instrument just
described, a "Dulciana" might be added, at a
further cost of about ¬£10, less or more, according
to quality of pipe-metal, &amp;c. Its compass will be
from Tenor C to top, or, still better, from B flat or
a lower note, the remaining sounds being obtained
by grooving to the Stopped Diapason. The Dulciana
is of beautifully delicate tone, slightly nasal;
when played with the Stopped Diapason it gives a
charming clearness and sonority to that soft stop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
When the Flute is added, we have a true choir-organ
quality, most useful in the accompaniment
of low and solemn music.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;Some builders or organists may recommend
a "Salicional," or "Viola di Gamba,"
or "Keraulophon," in place of the Dulciana. All
these stops, when properly made, are of beautiful
tone, but their beauty is of a kind which soon
satisfies, and then is apt to weary the listener.
They are therefore excluded from our village organ
by one of our maxims. The same sentence of
exclusion must be passed upon the class of stops
known as "Lieblich Gedact," and rightly introduced
in large organs as alternatives for the
Stopped Diapason and Stopped Flute. "Their
tone in the treble," says Mr. Hayne,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "is so peculiar
as to become wearisome, and a little of them
goes a very long way." The imitative Flutes,
which have many different names, as "Flauto
Traverso," "Concert Flute," "Oboe Flute," and
the like, find their place in organs of much
larger dimensions than our village organ; and
Harmonic stops, of every pitch and quality, are
shut out by their costliness, if not by the character
of their tone, which is unacceptable to some
ears.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> "Hints, &amp;c.," p. 14.</p></div>

<p>Organ No. 3. Perhaps greater loudness may be
reasonably desired when the village church is
large and the singers numerous. This accession of
power will be gained by adding two more complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
ranks of pipes, namely, a Twelfth of three feet
(nominal) and a Fifteenth of two feet, both in
metal. We cannot enter into controversy with
modern purists who object to the Twelfth. Enough
that its effect, when duly balanced, has been accepted
as dignified and elevating for centuries
past. As it is never used without the Fifteenth,
the pipes of both may be governed by one slider,
and in this case the stop may be called "Mixture,
ii. ranks."</p>

<p>The additional cost of the Twelfth and Fifteenth,
with the necessary enlargement of the sound-board
and bellows, may be ¬£20 or ¬£25.</p>

<p>Organ No. 4. The stops which have been enumerated,
with one or two additions, might be
distributed between two manuals, with great advantage
to the player, and without a violation of
any of our self-imposed conditions. Instead of
suggesting the list of stops ourselves, we give the
names and distribution of those in the beautiful
little organ in the choir of Jesus College Chapel,
Cambridge, designed by the late Sir J. Sutton,
Bart., and built by the late J. C. Bishop, some old
wooden pipes by Schmidt being worked in.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps we should not conclude without noticing
one or two objections to our plans.</p>

<p>First. "Organs cannot be properly played
without pedals."</p>

<p>Most unquestionably true classical organ music
cannot be played on instruments with manuals
only. But it was on such instruments that the
illustrious <span class="smcap">Handel</span>, with his contemporaries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
predecessors, Croft, Boyce, Worgan, the blind
Stanley, and a host of others, delighted their
audiences by their masterly performance. Pedals
were not added to English organs until the latest
years of the eighteenth century. The nineteenth
was far advanced before the pedal-board, of full
compass, had come to be considered an essential
part of every organ.</p>

<p>Why should the effective management of organs
without pedals be among the lost arts? Why
should not the clever manipulation of such organs
be practised by ladies, and by the modest players
in villages, to whom the preludes and fugues which
echo through the aisles of the cathedral must ever
be a dead language? Why should the cathedral
player himself, fresh from his pedal fugues, deem it
beneath his dignity to draw sweet music, in a
totally different style, from an instrument on which
Handel would have willingly displayed his powers?</p>

<p>We were present on a certain occasion, many
years ago, when the late Professor Walmisley, of
Cambridge, was asked to play on a small and old-fashioned
organ without pedals. The distinguished
pedallist and renowned interpreter of Bach's compositions
did not turn away with contempt. He
seated himself, and charmed all who were present
by his ingenious extemporisation. The skill, and
learning, and resource of the true musician were
never more conspicuously displayed.</p>

<p>We see no reason whatever why such a bright
example should not be followed; and, while we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
yield to no one in appreciation of the pedal-organ,
and of the music proper for it, we hold that the
typical organ of the village church has no concern
with these, and that no greater demand should be
made upon the executive powers of its player than
that which is made in the acquirement of a pure
<i>legato</i> style at the pianoforte or harmonium.</p>

<p>Second. "Why omit the Swell, the greatest
improvement of modern organs?"</p>

<p>The Swell-organ proper owes its effectiveness to
its reed stops, and these are one and all excluded
from our village organ by the fact that they require
the frequent attention of a tuner. We grant, however,
that reedy stops of the Gamba class might
take their place in small organs; and we admit
that our organs, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, might be very
easily enclosed in swell boxes, while a "Swell"
might take the place of a "Choir" in No. 5. Such
alterations would have many advocates, both professional
and amateur.</p>

<p>In adhering resolutely to our plans, we must
express the opinion that the judicious management
of the Swell is a gift rather than an art. It
is but occasionally, we think, that refined taste is
made evident by a sparing use of the tempting
contrivance. Too frequently, even in churches of
high class and pretension, the tone of the swell-organ,
with its mechanical rise and fall, prevails
from the beginning to the end of the performance,
until the ear longs for relief. If the abuse of the
Swell be thus common even in town churches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
is it well to trust an apparatus which may be so
easily misunderstood to the discretion of players
in village churches?</p>

<p>Moreover, our village organ is for the accompaniment
of singers. We believe that many musicians
will endorse our opinion that as an accompaniment
for singers the Swell-organ is misleading and unsatisfactory.
An accurate ear will often detect a
slight difference of pitch in the pipes of a small
Swell-organ when the shades are closed or suddenly
opened. We have repeatedly heard the
voices of the men and boys, even in very good
choirs, thrown out of tune by injudicious persistence
in the use of the Swell as an accompaniment.
The sense of discomfort and uncertainty
was removed at once when the player transferred
his hands to the Choir-manual, with its quiet and
cheerful brightness.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons, and not from any want
of appreciation of the effect of the Swell in the
hands of an educated and gifted performer, that we
counsel our village friends to turn a deaf ear to the
praises of the Swell which will doubtless reach
them from many quarters, and to rest content with
genuine organ-tone produced by means which do
not lend themselves to abuse.</p>

<p>A few words may be added for the guidance of
those who find themselves entrusted with the care
of old instruments.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century witnessed the erection,
in the churches of many country towns, of noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
organs, honestly constructed by true artists, men
who disdained the use of inferior timber or of base
metal. A great number of these costly and beautiful
instruments remained unaltered, or at least
uninjured, within the recollection of the present
writer, but demolition rather than restoration has
been at work during the last thirty or more years,
and the plea which we would put forward for the
reverent preservation of the works of old masters
may now be opportune in but few and isolated cases.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if it should happen to any of our
readers to discover in a village church, or in that
of some quiet market-town, an organ by <span class="smcap">Snetzler</span>
(1749), by his predecessors, or by his immediate
successors, ending with the <span class="smcap">Englands</span>, father and
son, we would earnestly counsel a respectful treatment
of the valuable contents.</p>

<p>An old picture may have long lain hidden in a
lumber-room, with its face to the wall; when
brought into the light, and its merits recognised
by an expert, its possessor replaces the worm-eaten
stretcher and decayed frame by new wood,
but he would indeed act strangely if he permitted
the house-painter to touch the precious canvas with
his brush.</p>

<p>Yet we have known many organs by the builders
and of the period indicated above, taken down and
carted away; their pipes (in Snetzler's case of
nearly pure tin) sold for a trifling sum or thrown
into the melting-pot; and this wanton destruction
has been justified on the ground that the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
is come for a "better instrument," that the old
organ is "screamy;" above all, that the belauded
"Swell" is wanting. Accordingly the modern
builder meets the wishes of his customers by providing
an organ of the common-place type, and
the reign of Swell-coupler and Pedal Bourdon is
duly inaugurated.</p>

<p>Surely a wiser course would have been this:&mdash;Carefully
preserve every pipe, and round out those
which may be bruised by rolling them on mandrils;
insist on the inclusion of all these pipes
without any omission whatever in the new structure
which the ravages of the worm may have
rendered inevitable; add to these original contents
(if funds permit) some modern ranks of pipes
carefully voiced by an accomplished artist to the
same pressure of wind, and calculated to support
and balance the shrill high tones which the old
organ doubtless contains; repair the old case, and
even retain the old key-board if possible.</p>

<p>No doubt, in towns, where a succession of skilled
players may be found, the addition of a Swell-organ
and of a pedal-organ, both most carefully
designed, scaled, and voiced, cannot justly be disapproved.
The instrument, thus reinstated, will be
a most interesting link with the past; will supply
in itself a history of the progress of the organ-builder's
art, and will possess an individuality of
tone which educated listeners will appreciate, and
which they fail to perceive in many or most of the
organs erected in the present day.</p>
